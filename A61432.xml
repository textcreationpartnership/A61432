            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. WHether the Divine Service, or <hi>Liturgy,</hi> (as from <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2. we may conceive it to have been anciently termed as it hath been in all Ages ſince) of the Chriſtians, hath not, from all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, been diſtinguiſhed into two Parts: The firſt, conſiſting of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, and Explication thereof; or Exhortation to the People, with ſome few ſhort Prayers, called, <hi>The Service of the Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens;</hi> The other conſiſting principally of a <hi>Solemn Memorial</hi> of the <hi>Paſſion of our Saviour,</hi> repreſented before the Father, as the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the Sins of the whole World, with Thankſgivings, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the Catholick Church, and all Mankind, for the particular Church, and People of all Orders and Degrees, where it was celebrated, and for all the Neceſſaries of humane Life, called, <hi>The Service of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> to which the <hi>Catechumens</hi> and Penitents were not admitted, but were excluded?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether this latter Part, called, <hi>The Service of the Faithful,</hi> hath not been retained and celebrated in all Churches of the World from the Apoſtles Times to this Day (except thoſe called Reformed) as the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and moſt ſolemn Part of the Chriſtian Worſhip, daily where they had any daily Worſhip, (as in moſt great Churches they had) from whence it had the name of <hi>Sacrificium quotidianum;</hi> in others, three or four times in the Week; and in all, every Lords Day? and the reſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it be any more than the Service of <hi>Catechumens</hi> and Penitents?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether there be any plain Evidence or Appearance in the Holy-Scripture, of any ſolemn Aſſembly of Chriſtians in the Apoſtles times where this ſacred Rite was not uſed; or that any preſent at any ſuch Aſſembly, where it was uſed, did ever depart without Communion or Participation? And whether the Sacred Hiſtory, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. relating that <hi>the Diſciples came together to break Bread,</hi> as the End and Occaſion of that famous Aſſembly of the Chriſtians at <hi>Troas,</hi> though <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo eminent an Apoſtle, was then to Preach there, and to Preach his Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Sermon, doth not thereby ſignify or imply, that, that was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the principal Buſineſs of that, and ſuch ſettled Aſſembles? And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41224:3"/>St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. ſpeak of their coming together <hi>to eat the Lords Supper,</hi> as the conſtant and Principal Buſineſs of ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies? and the ſame alſo be not ſtrongly implied in thoſe other Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42, 46. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whether by ancient Canons <hi>all the Faithful,</hi> who came to Church and heard the Scriptures, were not oblig'd to ſtay this Solemn Service of the Faithful and Communicate, under the Penalty of Excommunication?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whether there was ever any Doubt or Queſtion, whether all the Faithful ought to Communicate <hi>every Day,</hi> (that is, if where there was a daily Celebration) till the time of St. <hi>Auguſtine?</hi> And whether many did not continue to do ſo then?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Whether this moſt Holy, Solemn, and Peculiar Worſhip of the Faithful Chriſtians be not, being duly performed, moſt highly <hi>Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Father,</hi> by Solemn Worſhip and Recognition of him, as the Soveraign Lord of the Univerſe; and alſo <hi>to the Son,</hi> by like Solemn Worſhip and Recognition of him, as our Lord and Redeemer, and that we are all his Purchaſed Servants; and to the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> by whoſe Preſence and Virtue all Sacred Operations are perfected? And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over of very great <hi>Benefit to the Souls of the Faithful</hi> duly diſpoſed, by a Communication of Divine Virtue to them?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Whether what ſome Learned Men have rightly obſerved <hi>à poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori,</hi> from matter of Fact, <hi>That the Devil hath exerciſed and vented more Malice againſt this Holy Rite, than againſt any other part of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, except the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity,</hi> be not alſo credible upon Conſiderations <hi>â priori;</hi> from the Nature of the thing; from the Honour and Worſhip therein performed to the Father, and to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and to the Holy-Ghoſt; and the Benefits communicated to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls; but more eſpecially, becauſe therein that Paſſion of our Saviour, which the Devil had maliciouſly procured, is ſolemnly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and repreſented before the Father, as the great Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, to the Confuſion of that Proud, Malicious, and Envious Spirit?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Whether great Elevation of Soul and Devotion to <hi>God,</hi> and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of Souls in mutual Charity of one to another, being <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Benefits</hi> ordinarily communicated to Souls duly diſpoſed in the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and Reverend Uſe of this Holy Sacrament, Deprivation of theſe Benefits, and inſtead thereof, Diſſentions, Contentions, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, and Decay of Piety, and over-ſpreading of Wickedneſs may not be juſt and deſerved Puniſhments of the Neglect of ſo great a Duty and Solemn Worſhip, and of ſo Holy Means for the obtaining of thoſe Benefits? and may not therefore reaſonably be believed, to be <hi>Special Judgments</hi> of <hi>God</hi> for the ſame, when we ſee them follow Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Neglect thereof at no great Diſtance?</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41224:3"/>
                  <p n="9">9. Whether therefore <hi>Neglect of Communion by the People in the Greek Churches,</hi> where <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> preached vehemently againſt it, both at <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> may not reaſonably be believed to have been ſeverely <hi>Puniſhed</hi> by the <hi>Special Judgement of God</hi> and Malice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil getting Advantage thereupon, by the Diviſions and Confuſions which aroſe there not long after his Death, and continued till almoſt all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches were firſt over-ſpread with them, and at laſt over-run and enſlaved by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mohemetans?</hi> And in <hi>the Latin-Churches,</hi> by the abominable Corruptions, Abuſes, Impoſtures, and Uſurpations of the <hi>Papacy?</hi>

Whether the <hi>Neglect,</hi> not only of Communion by the People, but even of <hi>Celebration</hi> by the Clergy, ſo that ſuch of the People, as would have Communicated, could not, and in a manner <hi>taking away of the daily Sacrifice, in the Churches, called Reformed,</hi> may not alſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be believed to have been puniſhed by the <hi>ſpecial Judgement of God,</hi> and Malice of the Devil, by their Diviſions amongſt themſelves from the Beginning of their Reformation, and by the great Decays of Piety and Over-ſpreading of Wickedneſs, which hath by degrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed amongſt them ever ſince?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Whether in theſe Diviſions in the Churches, called Reformed, the <hi>Socinian Hereſy</hi> hath not had great Advantage, by their Neglect of ſo Pregnant a Teſtimony of the Catholick Church againſt it, as this of the Solemn Memorial of the Paſſion of our Saviour before the Father, as the great Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World?</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE Method which our Bleſſed Saviour preſcribed for the Reformation of what is amiſs in individual and private Perſons and Matters; <hi>viz.</hi> That it be gradual, and, <hi>firſt,</hi> as gentle as may be, by tacit Admonition, or private Reproof: and if that will not do, then to proceed only to the Audience of one or two, but ſtill in private, that there may be Witneſſes to atteſt the orderly Proceeding, as well as the Obſtinacy of the Offender: and then, indeed, if that will not do, to report it to the Church, or Holy Aſſembly of the Faithful: but never to expoſe the Perſon till all other Means have been uſed, and found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual and unſucceſsful: the ſame is, doubtleſs, according to his Will, ordinarily much more to be obſerved in publick Perſons and Matters. And this I have endeavoured, and do deſire to obſerve in the Matter in hand, which is of no mean Moment, but concerning a Principal Matter of the Chriſtian Religion, the moſt Solemn and Peculiar Part of the <hi>Chriſtian Worſhip.</hi> For, upon diligent Search, under the Conduct of the Hand of God, into Miſcarriages, and Matters amiſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, having plainly diſcovered and detected the ſame, to my own Satisfaction, I have given Notice thereof to ſuch as were concerned to promote a <hi>Reformation,</hi> and expected a juſt time for ſomething to be done, or, at leaſt, be begun for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: And having done all that could be done in Secret, I am now, by a regular Courſe of Proceeding, to make my
<pb facs="tcp:41224:5"/>Report to the Church: and, for that, ſince there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any opportunity to do it in a Synod, there is no other way left but this of the Preſs; And this I have been careful to uſe, with all the Gentleneſs and Deliberation that is fit in this Caſe to be uſed, if we conſider who is concerned in it, and how far. I have already, out of reſpect to thoſe in Authority, for no inconſiderable time, in a manner ſuppreſs'd, communicating but to a few, and ſome of the principal men, what I had Printed, though it did but in part open the Faults: and now I do but propoſe a Specimen of a Remedy to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, without expreſsly noting what is amiſs, deſiring only Leave to uſe it with my own Company, till ſomething more compleat be eſtabliſhed; that I may neither offend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by acting without Leave; nor my own Mind, by too much varying in a marter of this moment, from the good Order and Practice of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> nor yet be forced to make uſe of that Indulgence, which is now allow'd to ſuch, as I would not willingly be. And, poſſibly, from ſuch a Beginning, by the Favour and Bleſſing of God, may a good Reformation inſenſibly enſue, without Trouble or Difficulty; for in what is here propoſed, is very little but what hath the Authority of Law, and the Declaration of the whole State, that it was compoſed by the Aid of the Holy Ghoſt; and that Little ſuch, as is not like to offend any Man of Judgment, and truly Religious. And I ſhould be glad to have no Occaſion to proceed any further to the opening ſuch Sores, as I had rather ſee inſenſibly healed and covered, than expoſed to publick View. But I have ſuch Aſſurance, and Divine Atteſtations, that the Work I am imploy'd in, for the Reſtitution of this moſt Holy, Solemn, and peculiar Part of the <hi>Chriſtian Worſhip,</hi> to its <hi>Integrity,</hi> as well as juſt <hi>Frequency</hi> of a <hi>Daily Celebration</hi> in places proper for it, and Weekly in all Churches, is the Special Work of God, not only for his Service, but ordered by Himſelf, by his own Hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and under his Divine Conduct, that as it is no little
<pb facs="tcp:41224:5"/>Comfort and Encouragement to me, ſo it is a ſpecial and great Obligation to be Faithful in it. I am very ſenſible of the Obligation upon me, and very much deſire to pay all due Reſpect and Obſervance to all Humane Authority, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, as the Ordinance of God: but if they in Authority will give unneceſſarily Occaſion for a Conteſt, we muſt obey God rather than Man, and prefer the Authority of the Catholick Church before that of any particular Church whatever: and eſpecially the Honour of God and of our Saviour, before that of Man, or any Society of Men, be it what it will: and if nothing elſe will do, I muſt proceed, and open the whole Matter, in the Cauſe of God, to the whole Church, in the beſt manner that I can. And this is what I have to ſay here, at preſent, in Order to the Reſtitution of this <hi>Holy Service</hi> to its <hi>Integrity:</hi> For, for the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of what is here done, they may be more proper to have their place in the <hi>Notes,</hi> which are intended for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But as for that of its juſt <hi>Frequency of Celebration,</hi> there needs not that Caution, though what I have to ſay do reflect Shame upon our Clergy: For, 1. that may be without Diſparagement to the Conſtitution of this Church in this Matter; becauſe there be Learned Men, who have aſſerted in Publick, and are ready to prove, That by the Conſtitution of this Church, there ought to be a <hi>Daily Celebration</hi> in all Places, where there are but a competent Number of Devout Perſons to attend and commenicate. And, 2. it is but juſt and reaſonable to do it, notwithſtanding, for their Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation before God, and Reformation, to prevent what might be worſe for them. Our Wiſe and Gracious God hath given them a gentle tacit Admonition, by <hi>a ſmall Company of Daily Communicants,</hi> excited, and conducted by his Hand, from a private Room, to a publick Church; and, by degrees, from one without the Walls, at laſt, to one in the very Heart of this City, where they have conſtantly aſſembled for this <hi>Holy Service,</hi> without Intermiſſion of a Day, for a Twelve-month
<pb facs="tcp:41224:6"/>together, and thereby born a Teſtimony for Him, and been a tacit Admonition to all others, but eſpecially the Clergy. And I have formerly propoſed the Caſe by Way of <hi>Queſtions,</hi> in Print, which have come to the Hands of ſome of the Principal of thoſe concerned, and been under their Conſideration, beſides many others: And ſince thoſe have had no more Effect, I know nothing more proper for this Purpoſe than theſe <hi>Theſes</hi> and <hi>Concluſions,</hi> concerning the Frequent Celebration and Participation of the <hi>Holy Euchariſt,</hi> which I lately drew up upon a private Occaſion, little think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then of this, for which they ſerve much better, and poſſibly might be ſo deſigned then, by that over-ruling Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whoſe Thoughts are as far above ours, as the Heaven above the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. That this One <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbloody Sacrifice,</hi> or Holy Rite of the <hi>Bleſſed Euchariſt,</hi> doth ſucceed as <hi>an Antitype</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial</hi> in the Chriſtian Church, in the Place of all thoſe <hi>Bloody Typical Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Jews;</hi> as is taught both by Ancient Chriſtians, and by Learned Men of our own Church and Times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. That it is very Unworthy of a Chriſtian, to imagin our <hi>Memorial</hi> of what is actually done and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, to be leſs effectual for <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than were their <hi>Types</hi> of what was then yet to be done, for the <hi>Jews,</hi> for any Intent or Purpoſe whatever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this, being of as great Uſe to us, as were theirs to them, ought as frequently to be uſed among us, as were theirs among them, upon all juſt Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. That this <hi>Holy Rite,</hi> was a Rite <hi>in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe among the Jews,</hi> for Solemn Thankſgiving to God for any great Mercy or Bleſſing, as often as they met together to celebrate any ſuch; and was appropriate by our Saviour for a <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical Commemoration</hi> of His Paſſion before God, as often as Chriſtians ſhould have any Solemn Aſſembly for the Worſhip of God.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:41224:6"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> That this, being inſtituted by our Saviour, as the Peculiar Solemnity of that <hi>Memorial,</hi> ought to be uſed as often as we aſſemble to give Solemn Thanks for that great Bleſſing, or to offer up Solemn Prayers for the Obtaining of the Benefits thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. That it is a <hi>Rite</hi> of the Greateſt <hi>Honour to God,</hi> and <hi>to our Saviour,</hi> and of the Greateſt <hi>Benefit to Men,</hi> of any in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. Both theſe Conſiderations are both Great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> and Great <hi>Obligations,</hi> to a frequent Celebration and Participation of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Neglect thereof, in Reſpect of the Honour of God, and of our Saviour, is <hi>Ingratitude</hi> and <hi>Impiety;</hi> and in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Benefit to Man, as to others <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs;</hi> and as to themſelves, <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Folly;</hi> like that of <hi>Eſau.</hi> Heb. 12.16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. It is the <hi>Principal</hi> and moſt Solemn Part of the Chriſtian Worſhip; and ſo <hi>Eſſential</hi> a Part, that, in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſt Eminent Men of our own Church, our <hi>Service</hi> is not compleat without it, but defective, and defective in the Principal Part wanting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. Concerning <hi>Reading of a part of the Communion Service at the Altar,</hi> where no Communion is prepared for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or expected, what Concluſion is to be made, in Reſpect of God, to whom it is offered; in Reſpect of the Miniſter, who doth offer it; and in Reſpect of the People, who ſhould attend and communicate, is not hard to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. Not any One <hi>Solemn Aſſembly of Chriſtians,</hi> for the Worſhip of God, in the Times of the Apoſtles, or among the Ancient Chriſtians of the firſt Ages, is known ever to have been held without it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſ.</hi> 6. No Church upon the Face of the Earth, from the Time of the Apoſtles, to the Time of the Reformation, nor to this Day, except among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> is known to have kept the Lord's-Day, or had any ordinary Aſſemblies for the

                     <head>And as to the Communion, or Participation.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. By moſt Ancient Order in the Church, who-ever departed after the Reading of the Scriptures, or Sermon, and ſtay'd not at the Communion, and received, were to be excommunicated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. In the firſt Ages, till about the Time of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> we find not any Doubt or Queſtion concerning the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all to Communicate daily, if they were where it was Celebrated, and had no juſt Impediment. But then, when many, eſpecially among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> began to neglect that <hi>Holy Duty,</hi> that Queſtion aroſe among the <hi>Latines,</hi> and the more Devout continued to receive every Day, (an Argument of Daily Celebration then) and others intermitted certain Days.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. By Ancient Canons, if any neglected to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate for Three <hi>Sundays</hi> together, they were to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. It was Anciently commonly reputed a grievous thing, to be hindered from Receiving the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament;</hi> but to be denyed it, a grievous Puniſhment: and ſuch was the Judgment of the Church concerning the Importance of it, that to ſuch as were hindered from coming to the Church, it was ſent home to their Houſes by the Deacons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. It was, Anciently, not only Scandalous, but Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable in a Clergy-Man, to be in a City, or other Place, where it was celebrated, and not to attend, and communicate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſ.</hi> 6. Theſe Orders of later Ages, concerning Receiving at leaſt Three times in a Year, and ſo indulging a Neglect for all the reſt, are moſt juſtly, by <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſaid to be <hi>Certiſſimum Diaboli Inventum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſ.</hi> 7. It hath been always the Practice, and Advice of all Devout People, to be very frequent at it; and of moſt, to neglect no Opportunity. Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Concluſion concerning it, in his <hi>Holy Living,</hi> is very agreeable to the Sentiments of the Ancients, and deſerves to be Read by all.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:41224:7"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. From all this it appears, how far different the Devotion of this Age is from that of the ancient genuine Chriſtianity, and ſhort of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This <hi>Holy Service</hi> having been conſtantly performed in this City, in Publick Churches, ever ſince the <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>Janunry,</hi> 1694. and in the Heart of the City for a Twelve-month together, and frequented by ſo few, is a Notorious Argument of the miſerable Ignorance and Indevotion, for all our Pretences, both of Prieſts and People amongſt us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It hath been the Opinion of ſeveral Learned, Judicious, and Obſervent Men, that a great part of the Miſchief, which hath been in the World in theſe latter Ages, is to be imputed to ſo woful a Neglect of this <hi>Holy Ordinance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, for <hi>Proofs</hi> of theſe things, They who pretend to any kind of Learning, I ſuppoſe, will be cautious how they require it, leſt they betray their own Ignorance in Antiquity: and for others, they are not ſo much to be regarded, as to inſiſt upon them meerly for them: but if there be Occaſion, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Proofs, both Old and New, may ſoon be produced: And, in the mean time, for the Satisfaction of ſuch well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning People as doubt, they may be referred to Mr. <hi>Joſeph Mede,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> the preſent Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> in the laſt chap. of his Book of <hi>Religious Aſſemblies,</hi> Dr. <hi>S. Patrick,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Bp. of <hi>Ely,</hi> in his Diſcourſe of <hi>Frequency of Holy Communion,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> Bp. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jeremy Taylor,</hi> and others, who have ſeveral conſiderable Paſſages to the Purpoſe in ſeveral Parts of their Works, very conſonant to the Sentiments and Practices of the Ancient Chriſtians, and the whole Catholick Church.</p>
                     <p>And, certainly, it is <hi>a wonderful thing,</hi> that Almighty God ſhould ever permit the Enemy of Mankind ſo to impoſe upon ſuch, as may well be ſuppoſed did really intend his Service, and had a great Zeal for it, as ſome leading Men in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation; and that ſuch Men of Learning and Parts ſhould be ſo impoſed upon, as by a miſtaken Zeal againſt Superſtition, to aboliſh and deface ſo conſiderable a Part
<pb facs="tcp:41224:8"/>of the moſt Holy and Solemn Worſhip of God, and even of the true Notion, and proper Uſe thereof. But our moſt Wiſe and Gracious God, for moſt Excellent Ends, no doubt, though we cannot comprehend them all, hath again <hi>concluded all under Sin,</hi> that he might have Mercy upon all, aboliſh that Enmity and Uncharitableneſs which the Enemy hath fomented amongſt us, and teach us, henceforward, by a very remarkable Example, in the Work of God to attend with more Reverence and Circumſpection to his Conduct, and not preſume too much upon our own Conceits and Opinions. Theſe Men, who ſo much over-ſhot themſelves, had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Service of God, for their End; and the Word of God, for their Rule; and yet, How have they erred from both! done Diſ-honour and Diſ-ſervice to God, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Service they intended; and inſtead of the <hi>Pure Word of God,</hi> followed their own, or their Leaders, <hi>meer Fancies</hi> and Imaginations! The Great Buſineſs of Man upon Earth, is the Intire Subjection of the Creature to the Creator, in the Subjection of the Intellect, as well as the Will: and, therefore, it is abſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould have great <hi>Experiments</hi> of the Danger of Preſuming too much upon our own Opinions, as well as of adhering too much to our own Wills: And ſuch is this we are now conſidering.</p>
                     <p>And if we inquire into <hi>the Cauſes</hi> of it, they are ſuch as I have juſt now touched. 1. <hi>Not ſufficient Attendance</hi> to the Conduct of God over us; for he is always preſent in a ſpecial manner with all thoſe, who are imployed in any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Service for Him; to direct them; if they be careful to follow Him fully; and not unadviſedly conclude upon their own Opinions, like them, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 9. when they ſhould ask Counſel of the Lord. 2. <hi>Conceitedneſs,</hi> and Preſumption upon our own Judgments, which makes us apt to neglect that Attendance. 3. <hi>Want of Charity</hi> to ſuch as are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, and a <hi>Spirit of Oppoſition,</hi> apt to run without due Conſideration, and be inſenſibly tranſported, from one
<pb facs="tcp:41224:8"/>
                        <hi>Extream</hi> or Errour into another, beyond either the Conduct of God, or Mature Deliberation of our own Minds. 4. Want of due regard to <hi>Humane Authority.</hi> For though we muſt obey God rather than Man, yet we muſt be ſubject to Humane Ordinances too, ſo far as they are not inconſiſtent with the Orders of God: and even in thoſe things, wherein we cannot obey, yet have due regard to the Authority. 5. Having Mens <hi>Perſons in Admiration,</hi> and receiving their Opinions as the Oracles of God; a ſecret Principle of all Sectaries. 6. <hi>Indiſcreet Zeal</hi> without Knowledge, for the Honour and Service of God; another Occaſion of running out of one Extream or Errour into another. 7. Mixture of <hi>Temporal Intereſt or Concern,</hi> of Applauſe, Reputation, Power, or Gain: This is often very ſubtle and prevalent, where and when it is little ſuſpected. 8. Laſtly, though it be not laſt in the Order of Cauſes, <hi>Abuſe or Miſuſe of the Sacred Scriptures;</hi> a thing ſubtilely practiſed by the Divel, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply many times, though not always ſo, but too often, craftily, diſ-ingeniouſly, and diſ-honeſtly, by Men. There is in the Scriptures a Divine Perfection, ſuch as is in all the Works of God, but as much different from that Perfection, which Men are apt to imagin, as the Wiſdom of God exceeds Man's Wiſdom. And they who endeavour to ſet up a Humane Conceit of Perfection, though they may mean well, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that for Perfection which they can neither prove, nor others find there, they do great Injury to the Scriptures, by raiſing Prejudices and Scandals in the Minds of many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious People againſt them, and againſt themſelves too, as either ſilly, weak People, or Cheats, who impoſe upon others. The Scriptures are of no Uſe to ſuch as underſtand not the Language wherein they were Written, unleſs they have them faithfully Tranſlated; and, How ſhall they know which is ſo amongſt ſo many Tranſlations? Yet is there enough for the Unlearned, in what all or moſt do agree. Nor is the bare Knowledge of the Language ſufficient for a compleat Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

This is ſo certain, that they who have preſumed to ſet up their own Imaginations without due regard to thoſe Means, have left to Poſterity ſo many Monuments of their Selfconceitedneſs, Preſumption, and either Ignorance and Folly, or Diſingenuity and Diſhoneſty in handling the Word of God deceitfully. And though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend the Wiſdom of God in many ſuch things, yet may we perceive ſufficient Reaſons why he was pleaſed to order it ſo in this; (but this is no place to inſiſt upon that.) And therefore it is an Argument of Ignorance and Errour, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe, in any one, who ſhall require Scripture for ſuch Particularities as it pleaſed God ſhould not be recorded there, but be tranſmitted to after-Ages by other Means. It is found, by Experience, that ſome, who have mightily cry'd up <hi>the Pure Word of God,</hi> have, under that Pretence, ſet up, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon the World, <hi>their own meer Fancies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Under this Pretence hath the Spirit of Antichriſt as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſly prevailed, and impoſed upon People in ſome Places, as in others under Pretence of Apoſtolical <hi>Traditions:</hi> They who would confine Antichriſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> are as much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken as they who deny him to be there. He hath no leſs prevailed to ſuppreſs or oppreſs ſome important Truths under the odious Name of <hi>Popery</hi> elſewhere, than he hath done at <hi>Rome</hi> to oppoſe others under the like odious Name of <hi>Hereſie.</hi> It is a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> which may bear ſome diſpute, and deſerve Conſideration, Whether the <hi>Superſtition of the Papiſts,</hi> leading them to Idolatry, and Subjection to one of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures in the World; or that of <hi>ſome Proteſtants,</hi> who have pretended highly to Reformation, precipitating them into Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, Prophaneneſs, Selfconceitedneſs, and Contempt of Lawful Humane Authority, hath done moſt Miſchief? But certain it is, that <hi>the taking away of the Daily Sacrifice</hi> is as
<pb facs="tcp:41224:9"/>notorious a Mark of the Spirit of Antichriſt, according to the Apprehenſions of the Ancient Chriſtians, as any: and the Operations of Satan muſt have been very ſubtle, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions very ſtrong upon Mens Minds, to prevail with them ſo in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>By Men of theſe Principles was this Church abuſed and impoſed upon, and <hi>the True Engliſh Reformed Liturgy diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, diſmembred, and defaced,</hi> to gratifie their Humour, in the Reign of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. But God did not connive at it, but took off the Contriver of thoſe Diſorders within a Month; the King himſelf, who impoſed upon the Parliament in it, within a Twelvemonth; and him who miſled the King, by a violent and blemiſhed Death, not long after; and hath made that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Men to them of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> Pricks in their Eyes, and Thorns in their Sides, ever ſince; juſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for ſo pernicious a League, and continued Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance therein.</p>
                     <p>And though he hath not hitherto connived at it, yet doth he now, in a ſpecial manner, call to <hi>Repentance,</hi> by new Admonitions. <hi>First,</hi> By ſetting up an Example of Reformation; and, next, By diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Shame of the Miſcarriage: a manifeſt Call to take Shame to our ſelves, and give Glory to God, by humble publick Confeſſion, and ſpeedy Reformation. I may add, and, 3. By this late great Mercy, and ſo manifeſt Declaration of the continuance of his Favour yet towards us, notwithſtanding all our Ingratitude and Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Concurrence of all theſe together are obliging Calls, both of Encouragement, if we anſwer as we ſhould; and of Danger, by Provocation, if we neglect. It is a New Declaration of His Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Condeſcention, and Readineſs ſtill to receive us into Favour, if we will wiſely imbrace it, conſider our Ways, and ſet to our Duty in good earneſt, and not think to ſatisfie Him with the Formality of a Day of Thankſgiving, without any juſt Act of a real hearty Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Who can, or dare ſay, that this Divine Favour hath not been
<pb facs="tcp:41224:10"/>obtained of Almighty God by this Beginning of a Reſtitution of the Daily <hi>Chriſtian Sacrifice,</hi> under the Conduct of His ſpecial Providence, as a principal means, for a Manifeſtation of his Approbation thereof to the whole Nation. If we well conſider the Judgments both of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians, and of Learned and Judicious Divines of our own Church, in this Age, concerning the Prevalence of this Holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eans; together with the Circumſtances we are under, it will appear no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thing to think ſo. <hi>The Celebration of the Holy Sacrament</hi> (ſaith a late Biſhop, Dr. <hi>Jeremy Taylor</hi>) <hi>is in its ſelf, and in its own Formality, a Sacred, Solemn, and Ritual Prayer, in which we invocate God by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ, expreſſing that Adjuration, not only in Words, but in Actual Repreſentment and Commemoration of his Paſſion. And if</hi> the Neceſſities of the Church <hi>were well conſidered, we ſhould find that a Daily Sacrifice of Prayer, and a Daily Prayer of Sacrifice, were no more but what her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition requires. And I would to God the Governours of Churches would take Care that</hi> the Neceſſities of Kings and Kingdoms, of Churches and States, <hi>were repreſented to God by the most Solemn and Efficacious Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions: and Christ hath taught us none greater than the Praying in the Virtue and Celebration of his Sacrifice.</hi> And this is the Counſel that the Church received from St. <hi>Ignatius: Haſten frequently to approach to the Eucharist, the Glory of God: For when this is Daily Celebrated, we break the Powers of Satan.</hi> If all our Biſhops, Deans and Prebends did conſtantly and devoutly attend this <hi>Solemn Worſhip</hi> at their ſeveral Cathedrals, and there perform this <hi>Holy Service</hi> as it ought to be, we ſhould ſoon find that to be of greater Importance, both to Church and State, and the whole Nation, than all the Service our Biſhops ever did, or ever will do in <hi>Parliament,</hi> or the reſt at their particular Cures, Attendances, and I know not what occaſions to withdraw them from their proper and principal Buſineſs. Theſe are ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of Popery</hi> as ought to be reformed, if ever we expect to receive the Favour and Bleſſing of God in any great degree. How others can ſatisfie their Conſciences, I know not, but I am clear of Opinion, that they who take ſuch Preferments for Lucre ſake, and attend the Duty of them no farther than our Laws do require, are guilty of the greateſt Sacriledge: And that thoſe Princes and States, who preſume ordinarily to withdraw ſuch Perſons from the Service of God in their proper Places, to ſerve them in Matters of State, are likewiſe Guilty of Sacriledge, Impiety, and great Imprudence, to make ſo bold with Sacred Matters. The Reformation of theſe things would be a greater Demonſtration of real Gratitude to God, than any thing this Nation hath produced of a long time.</p>

                     <p>In theſe <hi>Forms</hi> thus diſpoſed is ſo much both of the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and of the <hi>Order</hi> of the moſt ancient Liturgies, that a ſmall matter more would make it One of the Compleateſt Liturgies in the World. In the <hi>First Part</hi> ſhould be more of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which may either be left to the Diſcretion of the Prieſt, or ſome of the Leſſons for the Day be uſed: And the <hi>Prayers,</hi> which are prepoſterous before the <hi>Creed,</hi> or the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> (v. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.) ſhould either be after the <hi>Creed</hi> and the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> or be reſerved to the <hi>Second Part,</hi> which is moſt agreeable to the moſt ancient Office for the Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens and Penetents, who were not admitted to the Prayers of the Faithful. And, in the <hi>Second Part,</hi> the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> or Thankſgiving, is much ſhorter than they anciently uſed: and the <hi>Commemorations</hi> for the Communion of Saints of the whole Myſtical Body of Chriſt, are not ſo expreſs as anciently they were in all the Liturgies now extant. I ſhall conclude with <hi>theſe Obſervations concerning Liturgies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Preſcribed Forms</hi> in the Publick Worſhip of God, and alſo for Private Uſe, are of Divine Original and Inſtitution.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That there is not any good and clear Evidence of the Ordinary Solemn Worſhip of God, ever performed in any Chriſtian Church, or other Religious Society, in any part of the World, without them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That therefore it is great Ignorance and Inconſiderateneſs at the beſt, but uſually great Preſumption and Impiety in thoſe, who dare to ſpeak againſt them in general.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the <hi>Jews</hi> did uſe Forms before our Saviours Time, and the moſt ancient Chriſtian Liturgies are ſo conform to them, that it is highly probable they were of <hi>Apoſtolical Original,</hi> as to the <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> or rather, that our Saviour himſelf, who certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the <hi>Rite,</hi> retained alſo the <hi>Forms,</hi> with ſuch Variations as were proper for the Chriſtians Uſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That theſe things conſider'd, and the Uſe of the Word <hi>Liturgy</hi> in the Chriſtian Church ſo ancient, univerſal, and appropriate to this Purpoſe, it is very diſingenuous to deny that St. <hi>Luke</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 13.2.) did uſe that Word, which we tranſlate <hi>Miniſtring,</hi> being joyned with <hi>Faſting,</hi> for Solemn Prayer by Liturgy, after the manner aforeſaid, compriſing more in that Word than ordinary Praying, by reaſon of the Solemnity of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Sacrifice.</hi>

                  <head>A PREPARATIVE For the <hi>Reception of Truth,</hi> for a <hi>Prologue</hi> to certain <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> deſign'd for a <hi>True Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Reſtitution of Primitive Chriſtianity.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>TRUTH is what in its own Nature is very Excellent and Powerful, is of Divine Original, of great Importance to Mankind, and greatly oppoſed by the Powers of Darkneſs and all Evil Spirits: And therefore it is the Duty, Intereſt and Wiſdom of Man, to have a great Eſteem, Veneration and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for it in all things, but more eſpecially in things of greateſt Importance, Matters of Religion. And becauſe it is certain and manifeſt to all Men, who will but conſider it, that there is not any more common viſible <hi>Obſtacle</hi> to it, than <hi>Prejudice of Education, Temporal Intereſts and Reſpects,</hi> and <hi>Pre-ingagement of Reputation</hi> for maintenance of Opinions received, eſpecially when intermixed with ſomething of Truth to ſupport them, it is abſolutely neceſſary to the Diſcharge of this Duty, Securing of this Intereſt, and Exerciſe of this Wiſdom, Eſteem and Reverence, to conſider well, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it in our Minds, that thoſe are no Principles of Truth, but commonly of Error, and Means, of which wicked Spirits make great Advantage to harden Mens Hearts, and make them obſtinate in the Errors, which they have intermixed with the Truths of God; and therefore be aſſured, that ſince we are all Fallible, there may be as much Truth on their ſide with whom we contend, as on our own; and that it is more likely that both Parties are in Error, than that either is intirely in the Right; and thereupon to ſet generouſly and impartially to examine and diſtinguiſh, and retain what is plain and clear, reject what is manifeſtly falſe, and leave what is doubtful and obſcure till God ſhall reveal that alſo, in the mean time as of leſs Importance; and where there is occaſion of conſulting others, make choice, as in conſulting Lawyers or Phyſicians, of ſuch as are not only well verſed in ſuch matters, but alſo diſintereſted, unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41224:24"/>and faithful. And becauſe to reſiſt, reject or make light of any Truth but offered by the gracious Providence of God, is a Sin of great Ingratitude, and very offenſive to his Divine Majeſty, and uſually provokes ſubtraction of his Grace and Spiritual Judgments, it greatly concerns all, who have any true Devotion to God, and conſiderate Care for their own Souls, to be very cautious that they do not unadviſedly reject or neglect any ſuch when propoſed to them; but eſpecially if ſuch as have been believed, profeſſed and practiſed, if of that nature, by the moſt eminent Saints in all Ages, and in all Parts of the Church of Chriſt; and more-eſpecially if ſuch as concern the Honor of God, and of our Saviour, the Intereſt of his Church, which is the Kingdom of Chriſt upon Earth, the Communion of Saints, or the Salvation or Conſolation of Souls, whether in the Body, or out of the Body; and more yet, if there appear juſt cauſe of Suſpicion of the contrary Opinions; as when the firſt Teachers differ and fall out among themſelves, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Men of their Followers afterward confeſs that what was greatly magnified by them before was greatly miſtaken; when Charges or Accuſations are of themſelves monſtrous and unreaſonable, as that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> publiſhed by two ſeveral Perſons, eminent in their own Parties, which computed, amount to above Five Hundred, a great ſign of more Partiality than Prudence, more Heat than Truth, and of more Contention and Calumny than of juſt cauſe of Accuſation; and one of the ſame Perſons after-terward confeſſing that thoſe of that Church are unjuſtly and untruly charged in many things; and eſpecially when that remarkable Note of the Apoſtle, <hi>viz. Going out,</hi> 1 Jo. 2.19. according to his Maſters Cautions before, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.23. &amp; 21.8. which by the Ancient Chriſtians is ſo much inſiſted on as a certain Note of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> is manifeſt beyond all contradiction. In all ſuch caſes a Godly Jealouſie and Circumſpection is highly neceſſary, that we do not obſtinately perſiſt in Error, and reſiſt the Truth.</p>
                  <p>So much is required of all Men, as <hi>Rational Creatures,</hi> that they be faithful to their Creator, and their own Souls, in the due Uſe and Improvement of their Talent of Natural Reaſon and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould farther conſider, that they have many ſubtile and powerful inviſible Adverſaries to contend with, called <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> and the <hi>Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World,</hi> and one chief, called the <hi>God of this World,</hi> who commonly puts on the <hi>Appearance of an Angel of Light,</hi> blinding the Minds of Worldly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41224:24"/>and Carnal Men, leaſt the Light of Truth ſhould ſhine unto them: and therefore be very watchful againſt their Wiles, beware of their Snares, be not conformed to this World, but transformed by the Renewing of their Mind, be mindful of their <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> their <hi>Renunciation</hi> not only of the Devil, but of the World, and the Pomps and Vanities thereof, and of the Fleſh with its Luſts and Affections, which are two great Engines of the Adverſaries, that they may attain to true Purity in Heart, that the Light of Truth may ſhine into it, and be kindly and effectually received. For this they have firſt the implicit Document of the Great Example of their Redeemer, their Lord, and the Captain of their Salvation; which they muſt follow if they do ſincerely indeavour to attain the End: and beſides the Explication of it in manifold, expreſs, written, plain Declarations, affectionate Admonitions, obliging Exhortations, and ſtrict Injunctions, they muſt be Doers of his Will, if they will know the Truth of his Doctrine; and be careful to avoid Pride, ſeeking Honor of Men, (<hi>Jo.</hi> 5.44.) and Conceitedneſs, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Levin of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks; be mindful alſo of the other part of their Baptiſmal Covenant, their <hi>Profeſſion of Faith;</hi> obſerve and conſider well the <hi>Order</hi> of the ſeveral Articles of their Belief, and ſtudy to underſtand the <hi>Importance</hi> of each: (For there is nothing in that <hi>Form of Sound Words,</hi> either in Matter, or Order, but is of Importance to be noted and underſtood:) and conſider well what <hi>ſpecial Means and Helps</hi> our Lord hath provided for them, for Evidences of his Word and Doctrine; and be careful they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect none of them, much leſs ſet them one againſt another, and abuſe what they pretend to receive, as is very uſual.</p>
                  <p>I know not any Means whereby Men are more effectually impoſed upon, than by Miſapplication of manifeſt Truths; nor any Matters, wherein, in this part of the World, they are more commonly deceived, or deceive themſelves, than in falſe Notions concerning <hi>the Two great Evidences of the Chriſtian Doctrine and Inſtitutions,</hi> the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> and the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> which, rightly underſtood and uſed, do mutually confirm and corroborate one the other; but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood, ſeparated, and abuſed, are the very Principles of all our Differences and Confuſions: The <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt upon Earth, and to have great Regard to the Intereſts of it, is certainly the Duty of all Chriſtians: but to deſpiſe or ſlight the Teſtimony or Authority of it, is a great Sin in it ſelf, and the Inlet to many others, and a Fundamental Error. To conclude,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41224:25"/>they who ſincerely deſire to underſtand and imbrace the Truth of Chriſtianity, muſt conſider what is required before their Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, declared by our Saviour in two Compariſons, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28, 31. what is to be performed after, declared likewiſe by two other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.44, 45. and what are the Terms upon which only Men may be Chriſt's Diſciples indeed, in expreſs Terms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated upon divers Occaſions, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.35, 37, 38. and again, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. and again to the Multitude, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26, 33. and the Danger of Denying or being aſhamed of Chriſt or his Words, the Doctrines and Inſtitutions delivered by Him in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or by his Apoſtles to the Churches, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.28, 32. <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.34. and laſtly the Danger of a fruitleſs and ineffectual Profeſſion, expreſsly declared in the concluſion of our Saviour's firſt Sermon upon the Mount, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in his Farewel Diſcourſe, when he went laſt out of the Temple, in the whole 25th chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> all concerning Profeſſors; whence it appears, how far People may go in a Profeſſion, and yet at laſt fail of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation: upon the conſideration whereof it may be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as many Souls do not miſcarry by Security in an ineffectual Profeſſion, as by living in groſs and ſcandalous Sins. To Souls thus prepared Truth will undoubtedly find admittance, and the Good Spirit will be ready to lead them into all neceſſary Truth.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:41224:27"/>
                     <hi>Indifferency and Freedom from any ſpecial Prejudice,</hi> more than what is common to the whole Nation, and as much above that as any Perſons in it; I mean that of Education; by which, tho' the inconſiderate Vulgar, and People of little Judgment, are very ſtrangely affected and moved, either fondly affecting, or childiſhly abhorring what hath nothing of real Good or Evil, but what proceeds from an abuſed or deceived Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yet Men of Parts, Judgment, and Experience can more eaſily extricate themſelves out of the fetters and manacles of ſuch Impreſſions and Prejudice upon conſideration of ſufficient Grounds and Reaſons. But the Generality of the <hi>Engliſh Clergy,</hi> and Non-Conformiſts, are under a double ſpecial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and Pre-ingagement: the Authority and Credit of their Party; and their own in particular, having not only imbibed a Special Opinion in the Caſe, but inconſiderately aſſerted, and ſo eſpouſed it alſo, beſides the Prudential Caution of not diſoblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or offending their Auditors: tho' many Proteſtants in other Parts are of another Opinion, and the moſt learned here have deſerted the old Cauſe, both in their Diſputes in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, and in their Controverſial Writings. And therefore, as every honeſt Man in any Difference would deſire the Judgment of ſuch as are moſt indifferent, unbyaſſed, and impartial, ſo every wiſe Man will deſire that they may be Perſons of moſt Ability, Skill, and expert in ſuch Matters: And in both theſe reſpects I know none more proper to judge of this Caſe than Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and the Gentlemen of Your Honourable Profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this all, that You are thus qualified to judge of this matter; but you have alſo a <hi>Concern,</hi> a double Concern in it; but, that it may be fairly and truly determined; a Concern which obligeth you to Impartiality, that the Truth may be cleared, and an End put to ſuch Differences; both in regard to the Places you hold, and the Intereſt you have in the Civil State of the Nation; and in regard of your Perſonal Intereſt and particular Concerns both in this Life and hereafter. For <hi>Matters of Religion</hi> are of no little Importance to the Well-being of States, as well as of
<pb facs="tcp:41224:27"/>particular Perſons; and to the Well-being of particular Perſons as well in this Life, as hereafter. And all this in a double reſpect; in reſpect to the Providence of God, and in reſpect of their Natural Efficacy and Tendency. It is very manifeſt, that almoſt all the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs, Troubles and Diſturbance which this Nation hath ſuffered for more than 150 Years laſt paſt, have proceeded from unhappy <hi>Differences about Matters of Religion:</hi> And it would be as evident, if duly conſidered, that there is as little Likelyhood, if Poſſibility, of any long Continuance of Peace without ſome proper Application to ſo fatal a Root of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief amongst us, for the Extirpation or Suppreſſion of it. Nor is this ſo vain, unreaſonable, or impracticable a thing to be thought on or attempted, as moſt Men are apt to preſume upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfulneſs of the Attempts which have been made, if better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd. It is no unuſual thing for Men to learn from the Errors of former Attempts ſo to correct their Methods and Meaſures, as to accompliſh with eaſe what others with great Labour were not able to effect. Many things in Practice are like Riddles in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, which, after many have found inſoluble by their utmoſt Study, appear at laſt, when the Secret is once revealed, very plain and eaſie to the meaneſt Capacity. But in ſuch Differences as theſe there is uſually <hi>a double Secret;</hi> the one <hi>Supernatural,</hi> managed by inviſible Miniſters of the Divine Providence; the other <hi>Natural and Humane,</hi> proceeding from Error of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or Corruption of the Will and Affections in one or both of the Parties: And for the moſt part there are Faults on both ſides, if not from the beginning, at leaſt in the Progreſs and Continuance of the Difference. For it is no unfrequent thing for ſuch as have a Good Cauſe at firſt, to ſpoil it in the Management.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch is the Caſe in theſe Differences in Religion, which have ſo long infeſted this part of the World: Wherein <hi>the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Secret</hi> is the Operation of thoſe Inviſible Powers by the Commiſſion or Permiſſion of God, for Correction of what was and is amiſs in the ſeveral Parties, among whom they aroſe; the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of which belonging more properly to Divines, I ſhall ſay
<pb facs="tcp:41224:28"/>nothing of it here. But of thoſe Differences, the first and most conſiderable are thoſe between the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and thoſe who pretend a Reformation. And the <hi>Natural and Humane</hi> Secret in them lies in certain Faults on both ſides. The <hi>Faults and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of the Papacy and Court of</hi> Rome were ſo groſs and notorious, that all good and intelligent People groaned for a Reformation long before <hi>Luther</hi> was born. But the <hi>Faults of them, who pretended to that Work,</hi> will appear, when well conſidered, no leſs, neither in Number, nor Nature: There is none of them all that is not notoriouſly guilty of Sacrilege, Schiſm and Hereſie; beſides divers <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Practices to promote or maintain their Party. It is even natural to Men to run out of one Extream into the other: and the Evil Spirits, when they are permitted, ceaſe not to inſtigate the corrupt diſpoſition of Men to the utmoſt they can. Hence have proceeded thoſe many endleſs Differences among themſelves, who at firſt differed only from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And their Faults and Miſcarriages are ſo notorious, that they are many of them confeſſed, acknowledged, and diſclaimed by divers of the moſt learned of all Parties. The <hi>Engliſh Reformation,</hi> which was not faultleſs before, was farther corrupted by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> (who, tho by ſome magnified as a Martyr, will appear in time to have been ſo miſchievous an Inſtrument both in Church and State, as makes him very unworthy of any honourable Character or Memory in any part of the Catholick Church, but eſpecially that of <hi>England</hi>) and ſettled at laſt thro the prevalence of a Party of <hi>Calvinian</hi> Sectaries, with ſuch Abuſes and Corruptions in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, as the moſt learned and eminent of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy have long deſired and indeavoured what they could to rectifie, but have never been able to effect, or ſcarce dared to attempt it in any great Matters, being abuſed and bug-beared with popular Outcries and Imputations of Popery, (with which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Nation have been very groſsly abuſed) when-ever they dared to aſſert or own any thing of the Primitive Genuine Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity contrary to the Nations of that Faction; who have been pricks in their Eyes, and thorns in their Sides, both to Church and State,
<pb facs="tcp:41224:28"/>ever ſince, by the juſt Judgment of God, for their Politick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances with the Corruptions of that pretended Reformation; which are in truth much greater than is believed or ſuſpected by many good People, as I may poſſibly, by the Grace of God, ſhew more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in due time.</p>
                  <p>But for the preſent, to calm the Minds and ſtop the Mouths of ſuch as may be offended at what I ſay, as briefly as may be, I ſhall only recommend to their Conſideration, if they be <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> the <hi>Expoſtulation</hi> of a late leading Man amongst them, Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter, to the zealous Anti-Papiſts,</hi> which, he ſaith, is <hi>written to try, if it may be, to promote our common Repentance, and to reform the <hi>Dominal Diſtaken Reformation</hi> of thoſe, who have ſinned by</hi> Extreams; <hi>which, by the aſſumed Name of</hi> Reformation <hi>have wronged God, and the Truth, and Mens Souls, with the greater Advantage and Succeſs.</hi> Thus of the Reformation in general in his Book againſt <hi>Foreign Juriſdiction,</hi> printed but little before his Death, <hi>Part 2. ch. 1.</hi> and <hi>ch. 7.</hi> he ſets down together no leſs than ſeven ſummary Heads of Falſe Charges and Wrongs done to the Papiſts by the Sectarian weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed part of Proteſtants, as he elſewhere calls them: <hi>1. Some Men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do ignorantly charge ſome Errors on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, which they are not guilty of: 2. or lay the Errors of ſome few upon the moſt: 3. Some make Errors, which are but</hi> de Nomine, <hi>to ſeem to be</hi> de Re: <hi>4. and leſſer Errors to ſeem Great: 5. Some take divers Truths to be Errors: 6. And ſome are ready to call ſome lawful Cuſtoms of the Papiſts by the Name of Popery and Antichriſtian: 7. Some would deny the Papiſts the common Civilities and Liberties which are their due,</hi> &amp;c. And elſewhere he gives us part of a Catalogue of ſuch raſh Charges with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to let us know that thoſe are but part: <hi>How far Proteſtants miſtake and raſhly Charge them in the Doctrines of Predeſtination, Free-will, Grace, Merits, Juſtification, Redemption, Perſeverance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have freely ſhewed in my Catholick Theology, and End of Doctrinal Controverſies, and</hi> Ludovicus le Blank, <hi>after</hi> Others,
<pb facs="tcp:41224:29"/>
                     <hi>hath excellently opened.</hi> Which is a plain Confeſſion that in all thoſe Differences, beſides that about Antichriſt, (which he does not at all approve) the Fault lies on the ſide of the Proteſtants and the Nominal Miſtaken Reformation. And herein I know no Conformiſts, except <hi>Calvinian</hi> Sectaries, who do not agree with him, and thoſe <hi>Others</hi> he mentions. And for <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> they may there ſee, without looking further, that there are and have been many amongst us of <hi>greateſt Reverence and Name,</hi> (as he elſewhere expreſſeth it) who have thought the Differences as unjuſt and unreaſonable on the Proteſtant ſide in divers <hi>other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;</hi> ſuch as Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> Arch-Biſhop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Guning,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Sparrow,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Parker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylyn,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> Dr. <hi>Saywell,</hi> Dr. <hi>Beveridge,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodwell;</hi> all whom he particularly names, and indeavours to anſwer: To whom might be added, for my purpoſe, Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Couſens,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Forbes,</hi> Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> and divers other eminent learned Men in and ſince the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> beſides divers now living. And a worthy dignified Clergy-Man of the City, in a Book lately printed, hath aſſerted that the Reformation was, and was to be, but an imperfect Work. By all which it is eaſie to be perceived, that <hi>the Cauſe of the Reformation</hi> is no ſuch clear Cauſe, or infallible Truth, as is generally believed, by thoſe who are educated in ſuch a Preſumption or Perſuaſion: Which might alſo juſtly be ſuſpected from the <hi>Differences,</hi> which aroſe preſently, and have been continued from the beginning with bitter Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between the Principal Actors in that Work, and their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parties to this day; which are things manifeſt to all People in all Places, where any thing called the Reformation hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. But there are other Matters very obſervable in this Caſe, as ſeveral <hi>indirect Ends and Motives,</hi> which probably might be, and certainly were the Inducements to many of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners and Promoters of it; the <hi>Irregular Manner</hi> in which it was managed and ſettled; the <hi>ſubtile Accommodations</hi> of the principal parts of the Work to recommend the Preachers, and
<pb facs="tcp:41224:29"/>gratifie the People, but undermining the Honour of Christ, and the Power of Godlineſs, and ſettling the People in Preſumption and Security upon a Falſe Foundation; according to the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Apoſtle, <hi>Speaking perverſe things to draw away Diſciples after them;</hi> and the <hi>Fruits and Effects</hi> agreeable thereunto; a plain Indication that it was not of God, but in the Nature of a Judgment, and that they knew not what they did, nor what Spirit they were of: which, tho' certain Truths, and very evident when looked into, yet are not ſo obvious to common Obſervation. Nor indeed, was I my ſelf ſo ſenſible of much of them till after much Study and Indeavours to promote the Service of God, and Good of my Country, it all ſeemed to me to be under <hi>an Enchantment,</hi> ſo that no Good could be done: Whereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the <hi>Fruits,</hi> according to our Saviour's Rule, upon a fair Invitation and Opportunity I reſolved upon a Retirement, and a <hi>Review of the Reformation,</hi> the Root which produced no better Fruits: And coming to it with much Sincerity and Impartiality, I ſoon perceived all this that I have here ſaid, and more, very clearly; and ſome things, which relate to the Civil State and preſent Settlement of this Nation; of which I ſoon gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to ſuch Perſons as I thought moſt proper, to acquaint His Majeſty with it; to diſcharge my own Conſcience, what-ever was farther done in it.</p>
                  <p>I do not deny but there was <hi>need of a Reformation</hi> of divers things: but none know better than your Lordſhips, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of your Profeſſion, how common a thing it is for Men, who have really a good Cauſe, to make it ill through Paſſion, Partiality, unreaſonable Demands or Charges, and ſuch ill Management as, if it come to Tryal, it muſt be found againſt them; or tho' it be not Good, yet through Partiality or Prejudice to think it Good; and then, when by degrees they have well fixed and rivetted that Opinion, and beſides engaged their Reputation in it, to perſuade themſelves that thoſe things are lawful for the Maintenance of it, which, in truth, are not; and thoſe things uſeful or neceſsary, which, in concluſion, will but expoſe and ruine it: how much Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb facs="tcp:41224:30"/>People thus affected frequently bring upon themſelves and others, and endleſs Vexations, when obſtinate in their Opinion, reſolute in their Demands, and pertinacious in their Contentions, right or wrong: how undecent and unbecoming, even in Civil Matters, this appears to all wiſe and good Men, who have Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to obſerve the Truth of the Caſe: On the other ſide, how much more Prudent it is, as well as Juſt and Honeſt, if a Man have the Misfortune to purchaſe an ill Title, or be unhappily concerned in an ill Cauſe, to indeavour to make it Good by fair Agreement with Parties concerned, and Tender of what is juſt and reaſonable; and ſuch honeſt Means as will at leaſt ſecure his Reputation, if not his Cauſe alſo, however much mend the matter. This has been always <hi>my Practice,</hi> and this I am reſolved to do in this Caſe, of what I have diſcover'd upon my Review aforeſaid: I do utterly diſclaim all the Iniquity of the Caſe that I have already diſcovered, or can diſcover, all the Sacrilege, Schiſm, and Hereſie, and other Corruptions of the pretended Reformation in general, and of that of <hi>England</hi> in particular. And tho' I do not forſake the Corruptions of this Church to eſpouſe thoſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet I think fit to make my own Cauſe good, and to ſtand only upon ſuch Terms, as I can comfortably refer to the Goodneſs and Mercy of God, and as I am ſatisfied will make it their Faults, not mine, who ſhall refuſe Agreement and Communion with me. What I think prudent in my own Caſe, if it be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I could wiſh the whole Nation did ſee it as well as I: For I believe it a more <hi>firm Foundation for a laſting Peace</hi> and true Happineſs than any other we can build upon. And if I be not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in <hi>the Matters in Difference,</hi> there is ſcarce any but ſuch, as many principal Men of the one ſide think ought to be yielded by them, or as all on the other confeſs may, for just Cauſe, be granted by them; or may be otherwiſe accommodated by only fit Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Expreſſions. To which, ſince the moſt conſiderable on both ſides have ſhewed a very good Diſpoſition, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Precepts of the Goſpel, and the Peace, and Repoſe, and Common Good of Mankind, eſpecially in this part of the World,
<pb facs="tcp:41224:30"/>which may have a great Influence upon the reſt, do require it; I believe it would be for the Honour and Interest of which ſide ſoever ſhould do it, to make the Propoſal, provided it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſt and reaſonable. Of thoſe Matters, which are thought ought to be yielded, this, which I propoſe to your Lordſhips Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, concerning the ancient Practice of <hi>Prayers for the Dead,</hi> is one, and the moſt proper Inſtance that can be in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. It is indeed a double Inſtance; for it is a plain Evidence, that one of the principal Suppoſitions, with which not only Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of People in theſe laſt Ages, but ever ſince the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, have been deceived and miſled, with very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretence, is notwithſtanding falſe in it ſelf, beſides falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious miſapplications of what is true: as appears abundantly by <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and the Common Practice of the Ancient Chriſtians in their Conteſts with Hereticks and Schiſmaticks. And it is in its ſelf one of the greateſt Inſtances of the Power of Prejudice to abuſe weak Men out of their apparent Interest, without any other competent ground or reaſon; of the Weakneſs of Men to be ſo abuſed; and of the Inconſiderateneſs of thoſe who preſume to be poſitive, and direct others in ſuch Caſes, that I know of.</p>
                  <p>My intention at firſt was to have publiſhed <hi>a Vindication of the True</hi> Engliſh <hi>Liturgy,</hi> the first Book of <hi>Ed. 6.</hi> compoſed by known <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy-Men, and afterward corrupted and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and a Faction of Foreigners, and other unknown <hi>Calvinian</hi> Sectaries in Secret, and ſo craftily impoſed upon the Church and Nation. But when I conſidered, in theſe unhappy Differences, how partially Zealous the Generality of Clergy-Men (who have any Zeal at all) are for their own Party, more than for the common Concerns of Religion, or of their Country; and how unconcerned the chief of the Clergy of this Nation are, and have been ever ſince the State aſſumed the Supream Power of Eccleſiaſtical Matters, as if either diſpirited, or preſuming that the Care alſo is incumbent only upon them who have aſſumed the Power; and how little I have found, by Experience, is to be
<pb facs="tcp:41224:31"/>expected from them; and, on the other ſide, how neceſſary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is for the Peace and Repoſe of this Nation, that the Occaſions of ſuch miſchievous Diſſentions ſhould be better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and removed; I preſently perceived I had a fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in this to preſent a proper inſtance of a Matter of ſuch Importance to Perſons as well qualified to judge, and who were likely to be as ſenſible of the Importance of it, as any; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon concluded to preſent it alone to the Conſideration of Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and the Gentlemen of Your Honourable Profeſſion; having already, as to the reſt, made a conſiderable <hi>Experiment</hi> of what I have here ſaid, of the <hi>Hopes</hi> we may have <hi>of a good Succeſs,</hi> if they, to whom it doth belong, will but do what is in their Power towards it: For having publiſhed a Liturgy, Entituled, <hi>The Liturgy of the Ancients repreſented,</hi> as near as well may be, <hi>in Engliſh Forms,</hi> not much different (only a little more compleat) from that Reſtitution of the True <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy attempted by the <hi>Scotch,</hi> with the Aſſiſtance of the Principal of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, <hi>Anno 1637.</hi> I preſented it to ſome of the principal learned Men firſt of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who much approved it, and wiſhed it reſtored by Law; then of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it, and declared their Satisfaction to communicate in that Form; and, at laſt, of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who had no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to the Matter or Form of it. And, in ſhort, to ſay the Truth, the Abuſe and Corruptions of the Publick Liturgy in theſe two particulars, <hi>Of Prayers for the Dead,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Sacrifice,</hi> to mention nothing more, are ſo groſs and notorious, that they alone are ſufficient to make the <hi>Church of England</hi> inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably Guilty of Schiſm, and juſtly obnoxious to Excommunication, (which may be the Enchantment it ſeems to lie under) and unſafe for any pious Perſon, after notice, to hold Communion with it: ſo that it ſeems not only expedient and prudent for the State to conſider theſe Matters, (for otherwiſe nothing is to be expected from theſe Biſhops) but abſolutely neceſsary: And ſo I leave it with Your Lordſhips.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Performance of any <hi>good Offices for the Dead,</hi> even to their Bodies, their Bones, their Memories, their Wills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath always been reputed a very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable thing among all civilized Nations; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath been acted to the contrary, barbarous, and inhumane; and the only Neglect of ſuch Offices by ſuch as were under any ſpecial Obligation, of evil conſequence; as if Mankind had ſome ſecret ſenſe that Separate Souls were ſenſible of the Kindneſs or Unkindneſs of thoſe who ſurvived them, and had ſome power to gratifie or revenge the Kindneſs or Injuries, eſpecially of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and ſuch as they had any ſpecial Intereſt in in their Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. And if ſuch inferior Offices to their Bodies and Memories have been ſo reputed, much more may ſuch good Offices, as <hi>Prayers for the Souls departed,</hi> deſerve commendation. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it hath been always commonly <hi>practiſed, by all Nations, Gentiles, Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and that without any known Beginning: but very probably by <hi>Tradition from the common
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matters tranſmitted from them, and received and conſerved by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> See Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s 2d Letter, § 8.</note> Parents of Mankind,</hi> being very agreeable to Nature, and confirmed by Apparitions.</p>
                  <p>And certainly this is a thing ſo <hi>innocent,</hi> ſo <hi>free from all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of Evil, ſo deſirable both for ones ſelf and their Friends, that it is very ſtrange that any, eſpecially good People, ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, nay frighted from it; and much more that any ſhould ſo preſume, upon their own Opinion and Conceit, as to offer to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41224:32"/>them ſo contrary to the Practice of the whole World in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and of the whole Catholick Church, without clearer Evidence in ſo obſcure a Caſe, as is that of the middle State of Souls to us Mortals: which is not to be believed could ever have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſecret Energy of thoſe Powers of Darkneſs, which have effected greater Miſchiefs than this by the ſame Inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>It is <hi>the Practice of the Jews</hi> at this day, and has been ſo without any known beginning: was ſo before our Saviour's time, as appears by the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and their ancient <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> which, 'tis ſaid, they uſed in the Captivity, ſtill extant in their <hi>Talmud;</hi> and never was reproved by our Saviour, or any of his Apoſtles, or of the Primitive Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>It is <hi>the Practice of the whole Catholick Church</hi> at this day, and of all Chriſtians, except ſuch as according to the unanimous Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Ancients are gone, and are, out of it; and hath been ſo without any known beginning, in their moſt ſolemn Worſhip; ſo that no Church can be aſſigned where they, who ſcruple at it now, could have had Communion without it: And never was <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,</hi> contradicted, or queſtioned by any one of any Reputation in the Catholick Church; or by any one at all for near 400 years.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, who is known to have queſtioned it, was <hi>Aerius,</hi> in the time of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> a Presbyter, a frantick, proud, conceited Man, diſcontented becauſe he could not get a Biſhoprick, and thereupon, 'tis probable, quarrelled not only at divers Practiſes of the Church, but at Epiſcopacy it ſelf: an ill Man by the Judgement of all; and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> reckon him in their Catalogues of Hereticks for his Oppoſition of this Practice eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>The next, whoſe Teſtimony is produced in this Cauſe, is one <hi>Stephanus Gobarus,</hi> and obſcure Scribler, and a confeſſed Heretick, even by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> who alleadgeth his Teſtimony, as well as by <hi>Photius,</hi> from whom he takes it, and who gives this Character of his Book, that it ſeems a Work of much Labour, but little Profit; and a Study rather of Applauſe and Vain-Glory, than any great Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It was a Collection of the different Sentences of the Fathers in divers points of Doctrine, and alleadged to prove ſuch a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Opinions in this Caſe, and what was the true Sentence of the Church. A ſpecial Witneſs, and to much purpoſe! an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick to prove the true Sentence of the Church! and a vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Perſon, who, out of Oſtentation of Parts and Learning, ſeeks for Differences in the Fathers, and ſets himſelf up for a Judge!
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41224:32"/>which he might, if he had pleaſed, have done alſo in the Scripture it ſelf. But after all he doth not ſo much as declare his Opinion in the principal Queſtion in this Caſe, but only in a by-point. A poor Cauſe that ſtands in need of ſuch Supports!</p>
                  <p>If we ſet him aſide, as well we may, who is neither a competent Witneſs of the Sentence of the Church, nor doth declare his own in this Caſe, we find not another in near 700 years after <hi>Aerius,</hi> till <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> and one <hi>Henricus,</hi> a runagate Monk, who took up a Trade of Preaching, and ſpent what he got in Gaming, and on Harlots: They denied alſo the Baptiſm of Infants, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sacrifice, Publick Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt them <hi>Petrus Clunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſis,</hi> a Man eminent for Learning and Sanctity, wrote, and St. <hi>Bernard</hi> preached, and confirmed his Doctrine with ſo great a Miracle, as convinced Multitudes, who had been ſeduced by them.</p>
                  <p>After theſe aroſe one <hi>Waldo,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Lions,</hi> very rich, but unlearned, who probably had a Zeal for God, but not according to Knowledge, and attributing too much to his own Opinion, procured certain Books to be written in his own Language, and diſtributing his Eſtate among the Poor, took upon him the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Office of Preaching, and began the Sect, called after his own Name, <hi>Waldenſes;</hi> and from their Place and Quality, <hi>The Poor of Lions.</hi> Among other Heterodox Opinions, (whereof ſome were peculiar to their own Sect, and diſallowed by all others) this of rejecting Prayers for the Dead was one.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Apoſtolici</hi> of that time, I ſuppoſe, were not a diſtinct Sect, but the ſame, who aſſumed that Name. And the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> who in the next Century encreaſed very much, till by the ſecular Power and force of Arms they were ſuppreſſed, ſeem to have been a Branch of the ſame Root; however, in this particular they agreed, as they did in moſt others.</p>
                  <p>Since thoſe, I know not any Sect which hath ariſen, and which queſtioned or contradicted Prayers for the Dead, till thoſe which have ſprung out of what is called <hi>the Reformation:</hi> For I do not find that <hi>Wickelif,</hi> and his Followers here, <hi>the Lollards,</hi> or <hi>John Huſs,</hi> or <hi>Hierom of Prague,</hi> who carried his Books and Doctrines into their own Country, and were all three Men of Parts and Learning, ever oppoſed Prayers for the Dead, tho' among the Opinions attributed to <hi>Huſs,</hi> one is, that there is <hi>no Purgatory Fire;</hi> which is denied by others, who yet are for Prayers for the Dead. But by all the ſeveral Sects of <hi>the later Reformers, ſince Luther</hi> began,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41224:33"/>they have been queſtioned, oppoſed, and left out of their Publick Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Only here in <hi>England,</hi> in the firſt Liturgy, compoſed by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy, in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> 6. which I therefore call <hi>The True Engliſh Liturgy,</hi> the ancient Prayers for the Dead were retained, both in the moſt Solemn Office of the Daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and at Funerals: But theſe and other principal Parts of the Liturgy were ſoon after new-modelled in a clandeſtine manner by <hi>Cranmer, Bucer,</hi> and other Foreigners, and <hi>Calvinian</hi> Sectaries; and craftily impoſed upon the Church and Nation: And the Abuſe is continued to this day.</p>
                  <p>This is the true <hi>Original and Succeſſion of all the Oppoſition</hi> which hath ever been made to this Practice, of all Mankind in general, and of the whole Catholick Church of Chriſt; by Hereticks, Sectaries, and Schiſmaticks, and the meaneſt of all thoſe; not a Man amongſt them of any Eminence for Piety, or any Virtue, or ſo much as Parts or Learning: much leſs any Man of Note in the Church: much leſs any Church, Party, or Part of the Catholick Church, who were, or who continued in Communion with The Catholick Church, or any Particular Catholick Church, as they anciently diſtinguiſh'd them from the Aſſemblies and Aſſociations of Hereticks, and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks in the ſame City. It is very obſervable, wonderful, and a great Evidence of unqueſtionable or undeniable Truth, that in ſo many Ages, when there had been ſo many ſo conſiderable Parties of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, and ſo malicious, ſpiteful, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, as many of them were againſt the Church, that none of the moſt conſiderable of them ſhould ever ſeek to advantage their Cauſe by ſuch a Queſtion; which doubtleſs they would not have failed to have done, had they apprehended any color of Truth or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in it: that none in all the Parts of the World ſhould ever oppoſe it but ſuch an obſcure, inconſiderate and inconſiderable Generation of People, till the late Reformers ſprung up, who thought they could never reform enough, or pick quarrels too much, till they had brought that, which might have been a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Cauſe, if well laid and managed, to an indefenſible brable. Amongſt them indeed there have been many Men of ſufficient Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but, but few of that Ingenuity, Impartiality, freedom from Prejudice, temporal Intereſt, or Fear of Diſpleaſing, and of that Generoſity, as to aſſert the Truth plainly, without reſpect of Perſons or Parties: and thoſe few have been very much born down
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41224:33"/>(among us eſpecially) by the Violence and Headineſs of Parties and Factions. Yet ſuch is the Power and Evidence of Truth in this Caſe, that it hath found Advocates amongſt the moſt learned of all Parties.</p>
                  <p>Of this I think it not improper to produce an inſtance or two in this Place: The firſt ſhall be an eminent Perſon both for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Virtue, Biſhop <hi>Forbes,</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Edenburg,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by King <hi>Charles</hi> 1. who is reported to have ſaid of him, That he had found out a Biſhop, who deſerved that a See ſhould be made for him. In his <hi>Conſiderationes Modeſtae, Controverſiâ de Purgatorio,</hi> cap. 3. §. 17. coming to ſpeak of Prayers and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Dead; <hi>Sed hic primum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But here first,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is to be reproved the Opinion of ſome rigid Proteſtants, who do altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cenſure and condemn Prayers for the Dead; becauſe they find no Precept or Example of ſuch Prayers in the Old or New Teſtament. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly even thoſe, who are moſt againſt it, dare not deny that it is a moſt ancient Cuſtom, and moſt (univerſally) received in the whole Church of Christ, that in the Publick Prayers of the Church Commemoration ſhould be made for the Dead, and Reſt be prayed for to God for thoſe who died piouſly, and in the Peace of the Church.</hi> And having cited divers of the Ancients for it, he adds: <hi>This moſt ancient Cuſtom was full of Piety, and moſt truly did</hi> Caſſander <hi>ſay,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>This was always fixt in <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41224:34"/>in many other things of leſs moment, had rather conformed her ſelf in this buſineſs, as alſo in ſome others, to the moſt ancient Cuſtom of the Univerſal Church, than for ſome Errors and Abuſes, which had by degrees crept in, plainly rejected it, and wholly taken it away, to the great Scandal of almoſt all other Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>I need add no more after this Learned and Apoſtolick Biſhop, only, in ſhort, take notice of what <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanus Regius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>None reject it but Epicureans and Sadduces;</hi> and <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> that <hi>No Good Man can diſlike it;</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> that <hi>There is little that can be ſaid against it;</hi> and conclude this matter with the Words of the learned and famous <hi>Hugo Grotius; The uſe of Praying for the Dead, received through all Churches of the Eaſt, no leſs than of the Weſt, ought not to be condemned.</hi> And after ſome reaſons for it, and ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> he adds, <hi>The Ancient Liturgies are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, ſince Christ himſelf did never reprehend the Prayers for the Dead, commonly uſed among the Jews; of which there is a Form extant in the Talmud, made, as is believed, in the Babylonian Captivity, and mentioned in the ſecond Book of the</hi> Maccabees.</p>
                  <p>It will be replied, That as great a Man, and of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as any of thoſe, hath written againſt it, the famous <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armath.</hi> It is very true he hath, and imployed and ſtrained all his Learning, all his Parts, and all his Skill, and a little too much, to oppoſe it; and all to very little purpoſe for his own Cauſe, but to very good purpoſe againſt it: For it is a great Evidence and Demonſtration of what Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> truly ſaid, That <hi>there is little that can be ſaid againſt what this great Man takes ſuch pains to oppoſe.</hi> The ſole Queſtion between him and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary was, <hi>Whether the Fathers of the firſt</hi> 400 <hi>or</hi> 500 <hi>Years held that Prayer for the Dead is both commendable and godly?</hi> as appears by the Challenge, which was in thoſe very Words, and no other. How, and where, doth he anſwer this plain Queſtion? His Title of that part of his Anſwer is general, <hi>Of Prayer for the Dead.</hi> He ſaw well enough how little he had to ſay to that plain Queſtion; and therefore reſolved to take more Liberty, to ſay ſomething of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Title, tho little or nothing to the Queſtion. He ſpends three ſcore and ten pages upon the general matter; but, if I miſtake not, not ten lines directly and cloſely to the ſpecial Queſtion.

                     </note> Which is to abuſe, not ſo much his Adverſary, as his Reader, with a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious appearance of an Anſwer, which, in truth and reality, is nothing to the purpoſe. That which comes neareſt to the purpoſe

<q>
                        <hi>Theſe Two Queſtions,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be diſtinguiſhed:</hi> Whether Prayers and Oblations were to be made for the Dead? <hi>and,</hi> Whether the Dead did receive any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Profit thereby? <hi>In the latter of theſe, he</hi> (the Reader) <hi>ſhall find great Difference among the Doctors: in the former, very little, or none at all.</hi>
                     </q> This is indeed to the purpoſe: but his Reſolution of the former Queſtion, tho' very true, is a plain Confeſſion againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For if they be agreed that Prayers and Oblations were to be made for the Dead, then certainly they held that that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and godly; which is all that his Adverſary did affirm then, and that I do principally aſſert now: for what I have to alleadge farther, is but a Conſequence of that. And his Reſolution of the latter Queſtion is manifeſtly falſe, and a diſingenuous Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for if among ſo great a number of Doctors in ſo many Years he could have aſſigned five, or ſix, or ten, who had really differed in that point from the reſt, (which thoſe few he cites rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood did not) had that been a <hi>Great Difference?</hi> And if ſome Authors do ſay, that ſome, or that many, in their time, were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the point, is that a ſufficient proof that it <hi>was ſtill a Queſtion in the Church?</hi> when they name not one Perſon in particular, much leſs any Doctor, nor tell us ſo much as of what quality they were, who had thoſe Doubts. When <hi>a Difference</hi> is <hi>Great,</hi> there muſt be ſome proportion between the Contenders: and where a <hi>Queſtion</hi> is continued, there muſt be ſome Diſputes, Contention, or Debates. But if Peoples ſecret <hi>Doubts</hi> muſt be taken for <hi>Queſtions in the Church,</hi> that is the ready way to bring all Religion into queſtion: and it is not to be doubted but ſuch dealings in Controverſies hath had its ſhare in producing this growth of Scepticiſm and Atheiſm of late. That ſuch a Man as this ſhould put Colours upon Cauſes; ſhould hold up Contentions; ſhould be ſo addicted to Parties, as in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to them to confirm People in Opinions, which if falſe are miſchievous, and if true of little Advantage, and contrary to ſo great Authority as is on the other ſide; and ſo expoſe his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Integrity, is a great Unhappineſs to himſelf, and a Scandal to others.</p>
                  <p>It is poſſible, what others may have obſerved in this great Man (for 'tis a ſcurvy thing to be ingaged in an ill Cauſe) may have taught them more Wiſdom; for, for ought I can find, as well in the Controverſial Writings of late, as in the Diſputations at the Univerſity, the Old Cauſe, <hi>An Preces pro Defunctis ſint Licitae?</hi> is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41224:35"/>quite deſerted, and that Queſtion is turned into another, <hi>An Preces pro Defunctis antiquitus uſurpatae inferant Purgatorium Papiſticum?</hi> It is well Men have learned ſo much Wiſdom for themſelves, as to mend their Cauſe ſo far as that; and it is to be wiſhed, that they may alſo learn ſo much Honeſty, as to undeceive the People, and reſtore to them, for themſelves and their Friends, the Comfort and Benefit of that ancient Catholick Practice. Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> one of the learnedſt Perſons this Church hath produc'd, and a <hi>late Biſhop of St. Aſaph,</hi> have done well to do what they could, and reſtore it upon their own Tomb-ſtones, tho' they could not do it in the Church: and if all who believe well, would but do ſo well, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs what they believe, which certainly they ought to do, we ſhould ſoon ſee the Truth revive and flouriſh beyond Expectation; and ſo, much of our Contentions abated.</p>
                  <p>Thus concerning the Perſons who have oppoſed this Practice, and ſet up themſelves againſt the Authority of the whole Catholick Church. I come now to conſider <hi>the Oppoſition it ſelf,</hi> their Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Reaſons. Such is the Wit of Man, and the Subtilty of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that ſcarce any Truth is ſo evident, but they can find out ſome ſpecious Appearances to ſet up againſt it. But ſuch is the Mercy and Wiſdom of God, that he hath provided ſufficient means for Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for all ſuch as keep within the Bounds of Humility and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; that is, in Subjection not only of their Wills, but alſo of their Intellects and Underſtandings, to his Orders, Ordinances and Preſcriptions, the very Buſineſs of their Lives in this World, for Preparation for another. And to ſuch, beſides the Common Means, he will kindly vouchſafe a ſpecial Guidance ſufficient for their Circumſtances. Of the Danger our Saviour and his Apoſtles have given to all fair Warning, and great Caution; acquainting us with the End, why the moſt Wiſe and Gracious God permits it, for Tryal and Exerciſe; the Danger and Subtilty of the Miniſters of Satan, ſuch as ſhould deceive, if it were poſſible, the very Elect; the ſpecial Marks to know and avoid them, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Fruits, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pretences, (Sheeps Clothing,) and Diſtraction and Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among themſelves, crying, <hi>Here is Christ, and There is Chriſt;</hi> and ſpecial Directions, <hi>Believe them not, Go not out after them.</hi> All this Proviſion hath the Devil attempted to undermine, partly by raiſing real Scandals and Offences, and partly by ſtrongly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Imaginary ones. But againſt all this Humility and Charity will fortifie us; and the Grace, ſpecial Guidance and Mercy of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41224:35"/>God will preſerve us, if we be careful to continue in thoſe Graces. It was Pride, and Arrogance, and Diſcontent in <hi>Aerius,</hi> which gave the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> Devil Advantage to inſtigate him to the firſt Oppoſition of ſuch a Catholick Practice.

For I do not find that he made any ſpecial Oppoſition againſt this Practice. But I doubt it was not imaginary, but real Scandal and groſs Abuſes of a good Practice, by which <hi>Waldo</hi> and his Followers, and the <hi>Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> were moved to oppoſe all without Diſtinction: tho' there ſeems to have been in him, with a Zeal for God, but without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a Mixture of Pride and Conceitedneſs. And it was real, and not imaginary Scandal, by which <hi>Luther</hi> was at firſt moved to oppoſe Indulgencies, and his Followers at firſt to oppoſe even this innocent and commendable Practice. But in ſuch Men as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> it was the Reputation of the Cauſe they had eſpouſed in groſs, and Compliances with the Times, and their particular Intereſts, by which they were moved. But let us but carefully follow our Saviour's Admonitions and Directions, wiſely diſtinguiſh the Ingredients of the Compoſition of Truth and Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and honeſtly imbrace, hold faſt, and own the Truth, when we have the Opportunity, and we ſhall not want ſufficient Light and Evidence to find it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſpecious Appearances</hi> ſet up againſt this Catholick Practice of the Church of Chriſt are theſe: 1. That there is no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Authority for it. 2. That the Ancient Practice was to Pray for all, ſuch as were at Reſt. 3. That the Ancients were not agreed in their Opinions concerning the State of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Souls, or the general Intention of the Church in thoſe Prayers.</p>
                  <p>To detect the Fallacy, Falſity, and Impertinence of theſe Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, as briefly as may be: To the <hi>firſt,</hi> I ſay, it is a meer Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, and grounded upon a falſe Suppoſition, that nothing is to be admitted in Doctrine or Worſhip but what there is <hi>Scripture Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> for, if it be underſtood of a <hi>ſpecial Authority;</hi> and their uſual Pretences of not Adding, or Diminiſhing, are to be underſtood of thoſe particular Parts or Books of the Scripture, as is plain by the Additional Writings and Practices of Holy Men afterwards. 2. It
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41224:36"/>is inconſiſtent with the Tradition of the Doctrine, and Inſtitutions of the Goſpel, and of the Ordinances of the Apoſtles, which were all by Word and Deed, without Writing, as the Common Laws of this Nation were at firſt ſettled: and much of what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, was written upon ſpecial Occaſions, and much with that Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Conciſeneſs, by the ſpecial Providence of God, as was ſufficient for them for whom it was intended, and yet ſo as ſhould need an Authentick Explication to preſerve the Authority of the Catholick Church. 3. It is contrary to the expreſs Directions of the Scripture, to contend for the Doctrine once delivered to the Saints, in general, and to hold the Traditions they had received, whether by Word, or Epiſtle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if it be underſtood of a <hi>general Authority,</hi> the Allegation it ſelf is falſe: For it is contrary to all thoſe Scriptures, which declare the Authority of the Church, and require Obedience to Superiors: And either way it is contrary to the Sentiments, Teſtimony, and Practice of the Ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who, in Queſtions of Difficulty and Conteſts with Hereticks, always inquired, not only what was written by the Apoſtles, but alſo, or principally, what was delivered by them to the Churches, which they founded, in all Parts of the World, of which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church doth conſiſt, which the Scripture it ſelf ſtiles the Pillar and Baſis of Truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. v. <hi>Grot.</hi> not only for the Senſe and Meaning of the Scripture, as Lawyers, with good reaſon do, when in doubts about the Conſtruction of Writings they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how the Uſage hath gone; for in that caſe the Writing is the Principal Evidence: but in this caſe, what was delivered to the Churches, which were compleatly and plainly inſtructed and ordered by the Apoſtles, was the principal Inquiry, and the Scriptures but an acceſſory Evidence, as our Year-Books are of the Common Law, in Queſtions concerning the Common Law. But I doubt not but there was a ſpecial Providence in it, that ſo much was written, and no more, and that it was written in ſuch a manner. Laſtly, This hath been the Practice and <hi>Pretence of Hereticks and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> in all Ages, to the intent with the better colour to ſet aſide the Authority of the Catholick Church, that they might ſo make way to ſet up their own private Opinions and Conceits in the Place thereof; but never more groſsly, nauciouſly, and ſcandalouſly, than by ſome of the Principal of the late Reformers, <hi>Calvin</hi> eſpecially, on the one ſide, inculcating and crying up <hi>The Pure Word of God, The Pure Word of God;</hi> and on the other, abuſing it, by ſtraining
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41224:36"/>wreſting it to ſerve their own turns, and eluding and evading what is plainly contrary to them; which is now paſt all doubt, not only by the Confeſſions of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and <hi>Le Blank,</hi> but the many of all Parties, who have deſerted divers of thoſe Aſſertions, which were ſo hotly contended for under that ſpecious Pretence: a plain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Demonſtration that they were no better than their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors in that Pretence. But beſides all this, what I am now doing, if I be not much miſtaken, will be a particular demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Truth of what I ſay.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>the other two Allegations,</hi> I ſay, they are both <hi>impertinent</hi> to the Queſtion under conſideration here; which is only concerning the Matter of Fact and Practice; I do not ſay that they are impertinent to the Subject in general, to be conſidered upon other Occaſions; but to this ſpecial Queſtion: and therefore to inſiſt upon them in this Caſe, inſtead of directly anſwering to the Queſtion, is fallacious, captious, and an abuſe to the Reader, to impoſe upon him, diſtract him, and withdraw him from the proper Queſtion. There might be Difference in Forms, and various Intendments, and all conſiſtent. Certainly there was no ſuch Difference or Variety either of Forms or Intendment, as there is this day amongſt Proteſtants of both, in their greateſt Solemnity of the Sacrament. But if the matter of Fact be certain, it may be in the Power of the Church to order the Form, and at Liberty for every one to conſtrue the Intention, or make his Inferences or Obſervations for his own Uſe, as well as of the Scripture. And the Matter of Fact is granted by the very Allegation: Nor indeed is it much denied by any Men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Scio eſſe pervetuſtam hanc precandi pro piè defunctis conſuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bucer</hi> in his Cenſure; and after he had a little indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to put off <hi>Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> he adds, <hi>Sed ſit hic quantumvis vetuſtus Dionyſius; Et ſit hujus atque aliorum S.

                  <p>Such is the Folly, Paſſion, and Inconſiderateneſs of Men, that they many times bring ſuch Cauſes to Tryal, as upon their own ſhewing, and hearing their own Evidence only, appears to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and indifferent Perſons to be againſt them. And ſuch I believe will this Cauſe of theſe Men appear to be to all competent Judges, without more a do. Notwithſtanding, for the more plain and full Conviction and Satisfaction of ſuch as are leſs intelligent and more ſcrupulous; and that thoſe Honourable Perſons, to whoſe Conſideration I preſent it, may themſelves judge of the Evidences, which extort theſe Confeſſions from ſuch as would elude them if they could, I will produce ſo much as is ſufficient for the purpoſe: and that I be not tedious, I will forbear all that, which would prove it to have been a true Catholick Practice of the whole Church for above 1200 years laſt paſt, and confine my ſelf to the time allowed and approved by the Church and State of <hi>England,</hi> that is, the time of the firſt four <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Of</hi> Nice, <hi>Anno</hi> 325. 2.

S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> was a Perſon of great Natural parts, acquired Learning, Piety, Holineſs, and of great Authority and Reputation in the whole Catholick Church, eſpecially in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, of which he is reckoned one of the chiefeſt Doctors. He had in his younger time taught Rhetorick at <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterward at <hi>Millan,</hi> ſo that he was acquainted with the World, as well as with Books, and every way as well qualified to bear his Teſtimony in the Caſe as poſſibly could be. S. <hi>Paulinus</hi> was a Perſon of great Quality and Eſtate, in great Eſteem with the Emperor, and of ſo great Devotion, that, imbracing our Saviour's Counſel, <hi>he Sold all,</hi> diſtributed it to the Poor, and pious Uſes, and betook himſelf to a ſtrict Religious Life in Poverty, after he had been preferred to great publick Offices; he was a Man of Parts and Learning, and well acquainted with the Weſtern parts, eſpecially <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and for his great Virtues and eminent Sanctity was, by the Importunity of the People, made Biſhop of <hi>Nola</hi> in <hi>Campania:</hi> ſo that he alſo was every way qualified for another Witneſs in this Caſe: and theſe two I ſuppoſe ſufficient for their time, eſpecially for the <hi>Latin</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paulinus</hi> in an Epiſtle to St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays as much as need to be in few Words; that <note n="*" place="margin">Vacare non poſſe, quòd univerſa pro Defunctis Eccleſia ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuevit, <hi>ap Aug. de Cura pro Mort. pr.</hi>

And theſe were all performed at the Altar, and with the Holy Sacrifice, except that at his Death, in caſe that happened after the Prieſt had eaten, and then by ſome Canons it was to be performed <hi>ſolis Orationibus,</hi> with Prayers only; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>&amp; Orationibus &amp; Oblationibus;</hi> that is, with Prayers and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice both, for that is there to be underſtood by <hi>Oblationibus.</hi> And as S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> did intend all this in what he ſaith of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Cuſtom by Tradition from the Fathers, ſo did he believe that the Souls departed were benefitted by them all.

                     <hi>It is not to be doubted that the Dead are helped by the Prayers of the H.

                     <hi>Nor are the Souls of the Pious deceaſed ſeparated from the Church, which even now is the Kingdom of Christ: Otherwiſe, neither at the Altar of God ſhould Memory be made of them in the Communion of the Body of Christ.</hi> In theſe words is couched one general Intendment of the Church: For as the Holy Rite of the Euchariſt was intended not only for <hi>the Peculiar Solemnity of the Churches Addreſs to God</hi> here upon Earth, with the Memorials of our Saviour's Paſſion, the great Propitiation for the Sins of the World, but alſo for <hi>Communion</hi> between our Head and the Members of his Myſtical Body here upon Earth, and alſo between the Members of his whole Myſtical Body themſelves; ſo the Church in that Holy Solemnity hath always performed <hi>Acts
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41224:39"/>of Communion,</hi> not only with the Head, but with all his Members, both preſent, in external Communion, and <hi>Participation</hi> of the ſanctified Creatures; and with all abſent, whether in the Body, or out of the Body, by <hi>Commemorations,</hi> Thankſgivings and Prayers. And becauſe they were in ſeveral States, they were accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred diſtinctly, in order, which is what S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> expreſſeth <hi>ſuo loco.</hi> This <hi>Communion</hi> was by the ancient Chriſtians reputed a matter of very great Importance, and accordingly they were equally careful, whoſe Oblations they did receive, and whoſe Names they did remember, whether Living or Dead: and thoſe who were ejected, or rejected or refuſed, were looked upon as out of Communion, and excluded from all the Privileges of the Church, both on Earth, and alſo in the ſeparate State, according to our Saviour's Promiſe. It was then believed, that the Souls departed, which ſhould be ſaved, were all indeed with Chriſt, but not at the Right-hand of his Father; but ſome before the Throne; ſome upon <hi>Mount Sion;</hi> ſome in the Holy of Holies; ſome in the Temple, but not in that place; ſome in Paradice, in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, in the Third Heaven, in very different Manſions or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles: as one may be ſaid to be with the King, who is with him in foreign Parts, tho' but in his Army, or at his Court, tho' never admitted into his Preſence Chamber; and that by ſome the Church here upon Earth her ſelf received much Benefit; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers received Benefit by her Communion and Prayers, and ſtood in need of it. Nor ought we to think that theſe two Articles of <hi>the Holy Catholick Church,</hi> and <hi>the Communion of Saints,</hi> were put into the Summary of the Chriſtian Faith and Profeſſion, and in the Order they are, but for ſpecial and weighty Reaſons; and indeed ſuch as are little taught, or underſtood, or regarded amongſt us in this Age.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> hath many Teſtimonies concerning this matter of Fact and known Practice of the Church in theſe diſtinct Orders of Commemoration of the Dead, ſo plain, that the Arch-Biſhop himſelf could not but confeſs that in <hi>the Church Service there was made a ſeveral Commemoration; first, of the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, and Martyrs, after one manner; and then of the other Dead, after another,</hi> pag. 194. and one or two he cites in the Margin, but was ſo wiſe as not to recite the words.

Wherefore here is all Merit acquired, whereby any one can after this Life be relieved, or grieved. But let none hope that he may obtain of God after he is Dead what he hath neglected here. Wherefore thoſe things, which the Church doth frequently uſe for Recommending the Dead, are not contrary to the Sentence of the Apoſtle, where it is ſaid,</hi> We muſt all ſtand before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive according to thoſe things which he hath done in the Body, whether it be Good, or Evil; <hi>becauſe even this Merit every one acquired for himſelf when he lived in the Body, that theſe things might profit him.

The Oppoſition, without any denial or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the Antiquity or Univerſality of the Practice or Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of the Tradition of either the Practice, or the Intention and Doctrine: which, if he had had any colour or pretence for it, he would certainly never have omitted: but he is able to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt either the Practice, or Benefit of it; but, If it be ſo, it is in vain to be pious; it would be ſufficient to get People to pray for the Pardon of ones Sins after his Death. In all theſe reſpects is the Oppoſition of <hi>Aerius</hi> a very conſiderable Teſtimony of both the Practice and Intention, and conſequently of the Doctrine of the Church in this caſe.

[<hi>as</hi> Solomon <hi>ſaith,</hi> Hear, my Son, the Words of thy Father, and reject not the Laws of thy Mother; <hi>declaring by this, that (our) Father; that is, God, the Only begotten, and the Holy Spirit, hath taught (us) both in Scriptures, and without Scripture: But] our Mother, the Church, hath Ordinances ſettled in her, which are inviolable, and may not be broken. Seeing then there are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances eſtabliſhed in the Church, and they are well, and all things are admirably done; this Seducer is again refuted.</hi> p. 237.

                  <p>To this we may well apply what he ſaith before concerning <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the Obſervation of which was another thing, which <hi>Aerius</hi> quarrelled at: <hi>But who knows theſe things beſt? This ſeduced Fellow, who is but newly ſprung up, and now living amongst us; or they who were Witneſſes before us; and who held the ſame Tradition in the Church before us, which they had received from their Parents, and their Parents had learned from their Anceſtors; as the Church to this day obſerves the true and ſincere Faith, which it received with the Traditions from the Fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all this we may obſerve, 1. The Practice of the Church, both in the General Commemorations, and in the Prayers, agreed on both Sides. 2. The End and Intendment of the Church, that it was the Profit and Benefit of the Deceaſed, alſo agreed. 3. The Queſtion between them, Whether the Prayer of the Living could profit or benefit the Dead, as the Church intended? 4. That this was what <hi>Aerius</hi> did principally deny: and therefore, that the Practice was reaſonable, as a neceſſary conſequence. 5. His only reaſon was, that it would make Piety and good Life needleſs. 6. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Anſwer, 1. from Reaſon; 1. as it is a ſeaſonable and excellent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claraction of the Faith and Hope of the Church; 2. as an Act of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for the Benefit of the Deceaſed; 2. from Authority, as received in the Church by Tradition from our Saviour, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And now, how does our great Man elude this? <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> ſaith he, doth not <hi>Name</hi> this, (<hi>viz.</hi> That Prayers and Sacrifice profiteth not the depa ted in Chriſt,) an Hereſie. 2. Nor doth it appear that himſelf did hold that they bring <hi>ſuch Profit</hi> to the Dead as theſe Men Dream, <hi>pag.</hi> 236. 3. He doth not at all charge him with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Doctrine of the Scripture, or the Faith of the Catholick Church, but with rejecting the Order, <hi>p.</hi> 237. 4. <hi>Aerius</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have been in force indeed, if the whole Church had held, as many did; <hi>That the Judgment after Death was ſuſpended until the General Reſurrection, and that in the mean time, the Sins of the Dead might be taken away by the Suffrages of the Living:</hi> But he ſhould have conſidered, as <hi>Gobarus</hi> (as great an Heretick as himſelf) did that the <hi>Doctors</hi> were not agreed upon the Point, <hi>p.</hi> 238.5. It was a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh part in him to confound the <hi>Private Opinion</hi> of ſome, with the <hi>Common Faith</hi> of the Univerſal Church. 6. That he reproved this <hi>particular Error,</hi> he did well; but that thereupon he condemned the <hi>General Practice</hi> of the Church, he did like himſelf, headily and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly, <hi>ibidem.</hi> As to the firſt of theſe, I muſt refer the Reader to

                     <hi>Epiphanius</hi> himſelf, for the Character he gives of the Perſon and Opinions of <hi>Aerius,</hi> a very Vile man, a thorough-pac'd <hi>Arian,</hi> and who exceeded <hi>Arius</hi> himſelf in his new Opinions, which he imputes to the operation of the Devil; though he doth not particularly <hi>name</hi> them Hereſies, yet, it is plain, he and S <hi>Auſtin</hi> too accounted them ſuch; and, of the reſt, the Reader may judge by what is here laid plainly before him.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Ephraem</hi> was not much before theſe; but becauſe he was neither <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Latin,</hi> but a <hi>Syrian,</hi> and a Man of Parts and extraordinary Sanctity, greatly eſteemed by the moſt excellent Perſons of that time, and of ſo great Reputation, that his Writings were read publickly in divers Churches after the Holy Scriptures, I cannot paſs him by without taking notice of his Teſtament, his Diſcourſe to his Diſciples upon his Death-Bed: wherein he tells them he is Dying, and deſires to be mentioned in the Commemoration of their Holy Prayers; and bewailing his Sins, and declaring his Senſe of the terrible Judgment of God, he doth admoniſh, exhort, and ſtrictly enjoyn them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him conſtantly, <hi>after his exit and paſſage,</hi> in their Prayers: and after ſome Admonitions to them, and account of himſelf, he again deſires to be remembred in their Prayers. Then he ſtrictly forbids his being Buried under the Altar, or in the Houſe of God, all Solemn Pomp, and Funeral Orations and Encomiums; and all coſt of rich Veſtments, of Grave Cloaths, of Spices, of Odors, of Candles, and the like; but deſires that all that Coſt may be beſtowed upon the Poor; and for himſelf; that in the place of all ſuch Pomp and Funeral Orations, they will accompany him with Pſalms, and help and aſſiſt him with their Prayers, and Bury him in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, where the contrite in heart are Buried. Then he bids them come near and imbrace him, for his Spirit fails him, and again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats them diligently to make Oblations for him; and prettily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> by a Simile of the Sympathy of things in Nature, the Wine which flowers in the Cellar, when the Vine Buds in the Vineyard, and the like: And tells them, that the Oblations of Prieſts under the Law were effectual for thoſe who were ſlain in their Sins: and how much more the Prieſts of Chriſt under the New Teſtament! And gives great caution, that when they come to his Memory, (I ſuppoſe he means the Thirtieth Day, which he expreſsly mentioned before and his Anniverſaries) <hi>ne quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in Sancta peccet;</hi> that none commit any thing unmeet for holy things, (by any Exceſs): but that the Vigil be kept atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41224:44"/>and reverently, and humbly, and holily, and purely: for it would be a miſerable thing for him, if by occaſion of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, he ſhould be accountable to his God for their inordinate Actions. Thus this Holy Man: an Inſtance equal to a very ample Teſtimony of the Practice in thoſe parts.</p>

<q>All theſe did the Emperor
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41224:45"/>dedicate, that he might conſign to Poſterity the Memory of our Saviour's Apoſtles. But he had another Deſign in his Mind when he built this Church: which was at firſt concealed: but in the end it became known to all. For he had deſigned this place for himſelf after his Death, foreſeeing, by a tranſcendent Alacrity of Faith, that his Body after Death ſhould be made <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Apoſtles Apellation,</hi> that even <hi>after Death,</hi> he might be <hi>eſteemed worthy of the Prayers,</hi> which ſhould be performed there in Honour of the Apoſtles, believing that their Memory would be <hi>uſeful and advantagious to his Soul.</hi>

                     <hi>Baxter's Queſtions</hi> in another Caſe, not unlike this, may very properly be propoſed to our modern Oppoſers of this Catholick Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: <hi>Would they have held Communion with the Catholick Church for a Thouſand Years together? Or would they not, if they had lived in thoſe times? If they would, then why not with us, who are of the ſame Judgment? Was it a Duty then? And is it unlawful now? If they would not in all thoſe Ages have held Communion with the viſible Church, what would they have done but ſeparated from the Body, and ſo from the Head, and caſt off Chriſt in all his Members, and taken him to be a Head without a Body, which is no Head; and ſo no Christ? What would they have done, but denied his Power, and Love, and Truth, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his Redemption; and his Office? Hath he come at the end of</hi> 4000 <hi>years ſince the Creation, to redeem the World, that lay ſo long in Darkneſs? And hath he made ſuch wonderful Preparations for his Church, by his Life and Miracles, and Blood and Spirit?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and promiſed, That</hi> the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it; <hi>and that</hi> his Kingdom ſhall be an Everlaſting Kingdom, and his Dominion endureth from Generation to Generation; <hi>and yet, after all this, ſhall he have a Church, (even as the Seekers ſay) but for an Age or two?</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> and very good: but if this be good in the Caſe of <hi>Baptiſm of Infants,</hi> why not as good in the Caſe of <hi>Prayers and Oblations for the Dead?</hi> which, I think, hath as good
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41224:46"/>Evidence of Apoſtolical Original as that, or the Lord's-Day, or Epiſcopacy, or a good part of the Scriptures of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And if they ſtand all upon the ſame Foundation, why ſhould they not ſtand or fall together?</p>
                  <p>There is alſo <hi>an Aſſertion of St.</hi> Auguſtin<hi>'s,</hi> which deſerves to be here conſidered in this Caſe; That <note n="*" place="margin">Quod uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa tenet Eccleſia, nec in Conſiliis inſtitutum, ſed ſemper retentum eſt, non niſi Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolica tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum rectiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimè credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>cont.

                     <hi>what the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church doth hold, and was not inſtituted in Councils, but always retained, is most rightly believed to have been delivered by no other than Apoſtolical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> For as this is a Practice which none did ever pretend was inſtituted by any Council; ſo amongſt all, who have written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Original, or firſt Invention, or Introduction of things, none has ever aſſigned any Original of it in the Catholick Church later than the Apoſtles; or in any part of the Catholick Church, later than of the reſt of Chriſtianity it ſelf. So that could we trace it no further back than the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> it would be unreaſonable to believe, that the whole Chriſtian Church, ſo largely ſpread over the Face of the Earth, and planted by ſo many ſeveral Perſons at firſt, and in Places ſo divided and remote one from another, ſhould ſo unanimouſly agree in ſuch a Practice, did it not proceed from ſome <hi>Common Cauſe;</hi> which could be no other than the <hi>Mutual Agreement</hi> of all the Apoſtles in it. <note n="*" place="margin">Noſtra qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Scripta cur ignibus meruerunt dari?

                  <p>But tho' this might be ſufficient, yet have we <hi>further Evidence</hi> to trace it, even through the more troubleſome times of the Churches, ſo near to the Apoſtles, that no Man, without Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to his Judgment, or his Honeſty, can queſtion its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to be indeed Apoſtolical. For tho' thoſe troubleſome times have left us ſo few Monuments of the Primitive Chriſtianity, in compariſon, that all will hardly equal the Writings of ſome one of the Writers of after-Ages; yet among thoſe few have we what is ſufficient. <hi>Arnobius,</hi> an eminent Profeſſor of Rhetorick, who had been a bitter Enemy againſt the Chriſtians, even in the time of Perſecution under <hi>Diocleſian</hi> turned Chriſtian, and wrote Seven Books againſt the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> in the fourth of which he expoſtulates with them in this manner: <hi>Why have our Scriptures deſerved to be caſt into the Fire?

                  <p>Another fifty years before this lived <hi>Tertullian,</hi> a Man of very great and univerſal Learning, very acute Parts, and very ſtrict for Diſcipline, and for the Orders of the Church. He mentions this Practice in divers of his Writings, not only as common and uſual, but alſo as delivered by Tradition, and ſo well known, and unqueſtionable, as to be it ſelf an undeniable Inſtance and Proof of unwritten Traditions. This he doth in his Book <hi>de Corona Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litis,</hi> § 3. where, amongſt the Inſtances which he alleadgeth for proof of the Authority of unwritten Traditions, this is one: <hi>Oblationes pro Defunctis, pro Natalitiis, annua die facimus.</hi> We make Oblations for the Dead upon the Annual day of their Departure; which the Ancient Chriſtians called their <hi>Natalitiae,</hi> or Birth-Days.

                  </p>
                  <p>This, I think, is plain, and full for the common Practice, both in private, and in publick by the Prieſt at the Altar; and for the Tradition. But it is <hi>objected,</hi> that <hi>Tertullian,</hi> when he wrote theſe Books, was a <hi>Montaniſt,</hi> and wrote them againſt the Church. And it is as eaſily <hi>anſwered,</hi> that it is not Matter of Opinion, but Matter of Fact, for which they are here alleadged: and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he was no Fool; which he muſt have been, if this had been the Practice of the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> and not of the Church. But for the Readers better Information, and more ample Satisfaction, that the Objection is a meer Scarecrow, and ſerves only to diſcover the Diſingenuity and Inconſiderateneſs of the Objectors, he muſt know,
<q>That <hi>Montanus,</hi> (and his Companions) <hi>Alcibiades</hi> and <hi>Theodotus,</hi> were at firſt looked upon, in the Opinion of <hi>moſt</hi> Men, as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:</hi> For very many Miracles of Divine Grace at that time wrought in many Churches made moſt Men believe that they alſo were Prophets.</q>

But what more ſpecially inclined him to favour <hi>Montanus</hi> was this: He was a Man of great Auſterity and Strictneſs in Matters of Diſcipline, Penance, Faſting, Chaſtity, Suffering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were things which <hi>Montanus</hi> aſſerted, and highly pretended to: And that which fixed

                     <hi>Montaniſm.</hi> And what is this to the Prejudice of his Teſtimony concerning Prayers for the Dead? It is ſo far from that, that it is the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and Amplification of it, that this Practice and Tradition was no part of Montaniſm: for nothing could have been a greater Prejudice to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt it, and it had certainly been condemned by them: nor peculiar to the <hi>African</hi> Church; but the known Practice of the Catholick Church, and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in particular: quite contrary to what the Objectors would perſuade us. But ſuch <hi>Infatuations</hi> are the greateſt of Men ſubject to, when they will obſtinately perſiſt in the Maintenance of an ill Cauſe. We may here therefore fix, upon as good ground as can reaſonably be deſired, this Practice and Tradition of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</p>
                  <p>And now it is time to conſider how much we are ſhort in our Evidence of the Apoſtles Age; and from what Original this Practice did in truth proceed. It is agreed that St. <hi>John</hi> wrote his <hi>Goſpel</hi> about the beginning of the ſecond Century; and that <hi>Tertullian</hi> fell to the Sect of <hi>Montanus</hi> in the beginning of the third. <hi>Vid.

And S. <hi>Hierom</hi> informs us, that he lived to a great Age, <hi>uſque ad decrepitam atatem;</hi> and that after he had continued <hi>uſque ad mediam aetatem</hi> a Presbyter of the Church, <hi>invidia poſtea &amp; contumeliis Clericor.

And what other Original could it have in that little time, and ſuch a Man as he have been ignorant of it? And had any other been known, could He have been guilty of ſo great Weakneſs, as to have alleadged this for an unqueſtionable Proof in ſuch a Caſe, if he had had ſo little Honeſty?</p>
                  <p>But we have here a learned Man, who under pretence of detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Impoſture, preſumes, by his Learning, to impoſe upon the World. How well he hath uſed his Learning in other Matters, ſome Learned Men of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I think, beſides others, have ſufficiently ſhewed; and how far his Judgment is to be relied upon. In this I ſhall ſhew the like in a word. He would perſwade that not only <hi>Tertullian,</hi> but the whole Church of Chriſt, hath been impoſed upon in this Matter by a counterfeit <hi>Sibyl,</hi> written between the Years 138 and 151. and of <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith poſitively,
<q>That he relied upon no other Hypotheſis than thoſe propoſed by the Author of the pretended <hi>Sibylline</hi> Writings.</q> But in theſe few words there is no leſs than at leaſt one notorious Fallacy, and two Falſities: a Fallacy in the word <hi>Hypotheſis:</hi> for he relied not upon any Hypotheſis, but upon the received Cuſtom of the Church: And that he did rely upon, as is confeſſed: But he did not in the leaſt rely upon any thing at all of the pretended <hi>Sibyl:</hi> Nor hath this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41224:48"/>Champion produced, I think, any one Proof that either <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or any other of the Ancient or Modern Chriſtians, did at all rely upon any ſuch Authority for that Practice: but all unanimouſly relied upon Tradition from the Apoſtles. His whole Book is full of Fallacy and Deceit, and of the very Spirit and Genius of an Heretick, who makes no ſcruple to abuſe the whole Church of Chriſt, and the moſt Excellent Perſons in it, to maintain his own Principles. It is certain, that divers of the great Truths of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity were known to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> long before, and received by Tradition from the Common Parents of Mankind; but received as Articles of Faith by Chriſtians upon the Authority of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: And ſuch was this, which he fathers upon an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and pretends the Church received it from him; without any Proof of either, whereas, if he was a Chriſtian, it is much more likely that he received the Hypotheſis from the Practice of the Church at that time; and is therefore rather an Evidence of it. Other matters of this Book have been conſidered by learned Men of our own Country; and I think I need ſay no more of this with any regard to him.</p>
                  <p>But as to the Practice, beſides all this <hi>poſitive and Affirmative Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> I do deny that any competent Evidence can be produced, among all the Churches of the World, of any where the Chriſtian Religion was planted without it, or where it was introduced by any particular Perſon, upon any ſpecial Occaſion, at any different time, after the firſt planting of Chriſtianity there, in all thoſe Ages ſince the Apoſtles; being verily perſuaded that no ſuch thing can be produced, but what will ſtrongly confirm and illuſtate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Evidence; like Mr. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s <hi>Flouriſh</hi> with his moſt ancient Manuſcript <hi>Miſſals,</hi> wherein the Commemoration of the Dead doth no where appear, which yet were but two in all, if not all but one mentioned by two ſeveral Authors, and that no compleat Miſſal nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only <hi>Liber Sacramentorum,</hi> an Abſtract, and it ſelf at laſt not to be found, as his expreſſion, <hi>habebatur,</hi> ſeems to imply: a good Argument of the Agreement of all, or moſt others in that particular, that ſo induſtrious a Searcher into ancient Records and Monuments of Antiquity, of that kind eſpecially, could neither ſee nor hear of any other, either at home or abroad, wherein it was not. Such another Exception may perhaps be met with, which may ſerve to confirm the general Rule; but not any thing conſiderable, I believe, to any other purpoſe. Certain it is, it muſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41224:49"/>either have been ſettled in all thoſe ſeveral Places in the World, where Churches were planted, together with the reſt of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrines and Inſtitutions; and then it muſt have proceeded from the ſame Founders, who agreed as unanimouſly in this, as they did in other neceſſary things; of which ſort this may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be concluded to be one: or it muſt have had a ſeveral diſtinct particular Introduction by it ſelf, in all or moſt of thoſe ſeveral Places, and be derived from ſeveral Authors, Originals, Occaſions and Times: and then the Accounts of its ſpecial and particular Introduction, in all probability, would have very much varied in ſeveral places, at leaſt have remained upon Record, or by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſome. But not a word of any ſuch thing, can I find, that was ever heard of in any part of the World; but a Unanimous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in all, both in the Practice continued by Cuſtom, and Original by Tradition from the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for Proof <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> from Evidence of Matter of Fact; which I think enough to ſatisfie any reaſonable Man of competent Ability, and to convince any Man of Modeſty and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity: yet becauſe ſimple genuine <hi>Truth</hi> is always conſiſtent with all that is ſuch, it may, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> gratifie an honeſt ingenuous Reader to obſerve briefly the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Agreement</hi> of this Catholick Practice of the Church of Chriſt, 1. With common Reaſon, and the Nature of things: 2. With the common Sentiments of the Primitive Chriſtians concerning the middle State of Souls: 3. With divers plain Texts of the Holy Scriptures: And 4. with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> in and before our Saviour's time, never reprehended by him, or any of his Apoſtles, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by all, and indeed practiſed by them: and, on the contrary, the Inconſiſtence of the obſtinate Oppoſition with Truth and Juſtice in divers reſpects.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Common Reaſon:</hi> The Univerſe is of vaſt and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable extent; in it we ſee are many great Bodies, Orbs, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; the Life of Man upon this of the Earth is very ſhort; the Time from the Reſurrection of our Saviour to this is near 1700 years, and how much more it may be to the General Judgment no Mortal knows; in the mean time the Souls of Mortals go out of their Bodies in infinitely various States of Purity and Impurity: And certainly it is moſt reaſonable that there ſhould be, not only one general Diſtinction of Souls, but moreover many diſtinct Places, States, and Conditions, wherein the ſeparate Souls are diſpoſed,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41224:49"/>according to their ſeveral Qualifications, when they go out of the Body. And as that curious Obſerver of the Works of Nature, as well of the Holy Scriptures, the late Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of towardly Plants by Death tranſplanted into another Region, a Garden of Happineſs and Comfort, adds:
<q>And poſſibly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time, as they received Improvement and Perfection here, ſo in that other Region they add to their Degrees of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and are promoted to farther Acceſſions, and Degrees, and Stations of Happineſs and Glory, till they come to the State of Spirits of juſt Men made perfect.</q> Now in all theſe Varieties of States is there nothing capable of receiving Benefit by the Prayers of the Living? Is there no Communion of Saints between thoſe in the Body, and thoſe out of the Body? But if there be, how can it better be exerciſed or expreſſed than in the ſolemn Offices of the Church?</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Common Sentiments of the Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe it would be too long to recite ſo many Teſtimonies in this place, and they are collected already to my hand by <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> and others, I need but refer the Reader to them. But this alſo is confeſſed and aſſerted by <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Dalle;</hi> but they would have us believe that they received them from an Impoſtor, a Counterfeit <hi>Sibyl,</hi> a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, impudent and impious Calumny.</p>
                  <p>The Agreement with <hi>plain Scriptures</hi> is obſervable in that expreſſion of our Saviour concerning the Sin which ſhall not be forgiven, neither in this World, neither in the World to come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.32. and that which agrees with this, of being caſt into Priſon, and not coming out by any means, till Payment of the laſt Farthing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.25. Priſoners of Hope, <hi>Zechar.</hi> 9.11, 12. Sins blotted out when the times of Refreſhing ſhall come, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. Such as ſhew the Incertainty of many Souls in their ſeparate State, even ſuch as were Profeſſors of a high Form in this World, of what their final Doom ſhall be at that Day, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. and 25.44, 45. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Recompence of Rewards at that day, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.14.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which if our confident Oppoſers had ſufficiently conſidered, one would think they ſhould not have preſumed to make ſo light of that middle State, as for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Parties to deprive ſo many Souls there of all Benefit they might receive by their ſurviving Friends here; which many <hi>Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> even among Proteſtants, do frequently ſignifie.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:41224:50"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Practice of the Jews</hi> I have noted already, and ſhall add only here, That in Diſcourſe lately with one of them, he aſſured me that the <hi>Form</hi> they now uſe for that purpoſe is generally believed by all to have been compoſed by <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ra</hi> and the <hi>Great Congregation.</hi> I there alſo remembred an inſtance of <hi>the Practice of the Apoſtles</hi> themſelves in <hi>St. Paul's Prayer</hi> for <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> in ſuch a Form as is hardly to be met with for any Perſon living, however proves it not in vain to Pray for any Perſon, of whom there is Hope, but not Certainty, till that day. So that tho' our great Man, with more Conſidence, I doubt, than Conſcience, and without any Proof or Reaſon at all, doth poſitively affirm him then living, <hi>p.</hi> 210. he gets nothing at all by it.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee in this a Univerſal Agreement in all things: but, on the contrary, if we examine <hi>the Obſtinate Oppoſition</hi> of it throughout, we ſhall find nothing ſolid and conſiſtent in it; neither with Truth, nor Honeſty, nor any good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: but a plauſible Pretence of the Pure Word of God to cover an impure Inclination and Deſire to ſet aſide the Authority which God inſtituted, and ſet up themſelves and their own Conceits in the place of it. 2. Inconſiſtent with it ſelf; firſt, denying or cavilling at the Antiquity or Univerſality of the Practice; and then, when they thought they had found out an Evaſion, confeſſing that, which they could no longer for ſhame deny, and betaking themſelves to their new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention: 3. Inconſiſtent with the Sincerity, Simplicity, and Ingenuity of the Goſpel, in their ſhameleſs Shuffles, Cavils and Evaſions; of which I have noted divers, and many more might be obſerved; but there is one not to be omitted here; their alleadging the Writings of <hi>Epiphanius, Chryſoſtome, Auguſtin,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, againſt not only their own, but the confeſſed ancient Practice of the Church in their time, in this Caſe: Inconſiſtent with that Modeſty, Reſpect and Decency which the Goſpel requires toward all, in their Cenſuring as <hi>delirous,</hi> not only ſome particular Perſons, but generally all the moſt Holy, Ancient Chriſtians, in what was their common Sentiments, and is believed by the moſt learned of the <hi>Church of England</hi> to be plainly taught in the Holy Scriptures: 5. Inconſiſtent with that Reverence and Regard that Chriſtians ſhould have for the Honour of the Church of Chriſt, his Promiſes to it, and Care of it, in ſo foul and ſcandalous an Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that they received their common Notions of the preſent State of ſeparate Souls in the other World from an Impoſtor; which, was not their Impudence therein as notorious as it is groundleſs, and deſtitute of any proof at all, might prove a Tentation to unſettled Souls, to ſuſpect all to be no better: And for other Conſequences, it is plain they lead the way to all others to reject their own uſurped Authority with the ſame Eaſe and Impudence that they do that of the Church of Chriſt; and to ſet up their own Conceits againſt theirs, and pretend Scripture for it; and ſo to an endleſs Courſe of Separations, Schiſms, Sects and Confuſions; and, in concluſion, ſet up that Authority over others, which they themſelves in the mean time reject; as by their <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> and others in <hi>France</hi> appears: And beſides all this, it is much to be feared, that they lead multitudes of Souls into that miſerable Security and Preſumption, wherewith our Saviour hath acquainted us that many will find themſelves deceived at that day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. And therefore if theſe be not pertinacious Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, ſpeaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things to draw away Diſciples after them, and therefore carefully to be avoided, I know not who are; or what ſo many Cautions in the Scripture to that purpoſe do ſignifie.</p>

                     <p>THE Holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> promiſed to the bleſſed Thief, That he ſhould <hi>that Day be with Him in Paradice:</hi> which therefore was certainly a Place or State of Bleſſedneſs, becauſe it was a Promiſe; and in the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whoſe penal and afflictive part of his Work of Redemption was finiſhed upon the Croſs. Our Bleſſed Lord did not promiſe he ſhould that day be with him in his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> for that day it was not opened, and the everlaſting doors of thoſe interior Receſſes were to be ſhut till after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that himſelf was to aſcend thither, and make way for all his Servants to enter, in the ſame Method in which he went before us. Our Bleſſed Lord <hi>deſcended into Hell,</hi> ſaith the Creed of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, from the Sermon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as he from the Words of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> that is, into the State of Separation and common Receptacle of Spirits, according to the Style of Scripture. But the Name of <hi>Hell</hi> is no where in Scripture an appellative of the Kingdom of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41224:51"/>Chriſt, of the Place of final and ſupream Glory. But concerning the Verification of our Lord's Promiſe to the beatified Thief, and his own State of Separation, we muſt take what Light we can from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and what we can from the Doctrine of the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> had two great Revelations: he was wrapt up into Paradice, and he was wrapt up into the third Heaven: and and theſe he calls <hi>Viſions,</hi> and <hi>Revelations,</hi> not one, but divers: for Paradice is diſtinguiſhed from the Heaven of the Bleſſed, being it ſelf a Receptacle of Holy Souls made illuſtrious with Viſitations of Angels, and happy by being a Repoſitory for ſuch Spirits, who at the day of Judgment ſhall go forth into Eternal Glory. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim Chriſt hath trod all the Paths before us, and this alſo we muſt paſs through to arrive at the Courts of Heaven. <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> ſaid it was the Doctrine of Heretical Perſons, to ſay that the Souls of the Bleſſed inſtantly, upon the Separation from their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, enter into the higheſt Heaven. And <hi>Irenaeus</hi> makes Heaven and the intermediate Receptacle of Souls to be diſtinct Places; both bleſſed, but hugely differing in degrees. <hi>Tertullian</hi> is dogmatical in the Aſſertion, that till the Voice of the great Arch-Angel be heard, and as long as Chriſt ſits at the right-hand of his Father, making Interceſſion for the Church, ſo long bleſſed Souls muſt expect the Aſſembling of their Brethren, the great Congregation of the Church, that they may all paſs from their outward Courts into the inward Tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, to the Throne of God. And as it is certain that no Soul could enter into Glory before our Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, by whom we hope to have Acceſs: So it is moſt agreeable to the proportion of the Myſteries of our Redemption, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Entrance into Glory to have been made by our Lord at his Glorious Aſcenſion; and that his Soul went not thither before then, to come back again, to be contracted into the Span of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and dwell Forty days in his Body upon Earth. But that he ſhould return from Paradice, that is, from the common Receptacle of departed Spirits, who died in the Love of God, to Earth again, had in it no leſſening of his Condition; ſince Himſelf in Mercy called back <hi>Lazarus</hi> from thence, and ſome others alſo returned to live a Life of Grace, which in all Senſes is leſs than the leaſt of Glories. Sufficient it is to us, that all Holy Souls departing go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands, that is, into the Cuſtody of our Lord; that they reſt from their Labours; that their Works ſhall follow them, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them too, at the day of Judgment; that they are Happy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41224:51"/>that they are viſited by Angels; that God ſends, as he pleaſes, excellent Irradiations and Types of Glory to entertain them in their Manſions; that their Condition is ſecured: but the Crown of Righteouſneſs is laid up againſt the great Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then to be produced and given to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and to all that love the Coming of our Lord; that is, to all, who either here in Duty, or in their Receptacles, with Joy and certain Hope long for the Revelation of that day. At the Day of Judgment Chriſt will <hi>ſend the Angels, and they ſhall gather together the Elect from the four Winds;</hi> and all the Refuſe of Men, evil Perſons, they ſhall <hi>throw into Everlaſting Burning.</hi> Then our Bleſſed Lord ſhall call to the Elect to enter into the Kingdom, and reject the Curſed into the Portion of <hi>Devils; for whom the Fire</hi> is but now <hi>prepared</hi> in the interval. <hi>For we must all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Christ,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that every Man may receive</hi> in his Body <hi>according as he hath done, whether it be Good or Evil.</hi> Out of the Body the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is not. And therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> affirms, that <hi>God hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Evil Angels into Chains of Darkneſs, to be reſerved unto Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the Angels, which kept not their firſt Eſtate, but left their firſt Habitation, he hath reſerved in everlaſting Chains, under Darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the Great Day.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Devils expoſtulated with our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Art Thou come to Torment us before the Time?</hi> And the ſame alſo he does to Evil Men, <hi>Reſerving the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt unto the Day of Judgment to be puniſhed.</hi> For ſince the Actions, which are to be judged, are the Actions of the whole Man, ſo alſo muſt be the Judicature. And our Bleſſed Saviour intimated this to his Apoſtles; <hi>In my Father's Houſe are many Manſions: but I go to prepare a Place for you. And if I go away, I will come again, and take you unto me; that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi> At Chriſt's ſecond Coming this is to be performed. Many outer Courts, many different Places, or different States, there may be; and yet there is a <hi>Place,</hi> whither holy Souls ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at laſt, which was not then ready for us, and was not to be entred into until the Entrance of our Lord had made the <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> and that is, certainly, <hi>the Higheſt Heaven,</hi> called by St. <hi>Paul, the third Heaven;</hi> becauſe the other Receptacles were ready, and full of holy Souls, Patriarchs and Prophets, and holy Men of God; concerning whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms expreſsly, that <hi>the Fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the Promiſes: God having provided ſome better thing for us, that they without us ſhould not be made Perfect.</hi> Therefore certain it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41224:52"/>is that their Condition was a State of Imperfection, and yet they were placed in Paradice, in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom: and thither Chriſt went, and the bleſſed Thief attended Him. And then it was that Chriſt made their Condition better. For tho' ſtill it be a Place of Relation in order to ſomething beyond it, yet the Term and Object of their Hope is changed. They ſate in the Regions of Darkneſs, expecting that Great Promiſe made to <hi>Adam</hi> and the Patriarchs, the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> but when He that was promiſed came, He <hi>preached to the Spirits in Priſon,</hi> He communicated to them the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel, the Secrets of the Kingdom, the things <hi>hiddea from</hi> eternal <hi>Ages,</hi> and taught them to look up to the Glories purchaſed by his Paſſion, and made the term of their Expectation be his ſecond Coming, and the Objects of their Hope, the Glories of the Beatifick Viſion. And altho' the State of Separation is ſometimes in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture called <hi>Heaven,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Hell;</hi> (for theſe Words in Scripture are of large Significations;) yet it is never called <hi>the third Heaven,</hi> nor <hi>the Hell of the damned.</hi> For altho' concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it nothing is clearly revealed, or what is their Portion till the Day of Judgment; yet it is intimated in a Parable, that between Good and Evil Spirits, even in the State of Separation, there is a Diſtance of Place. Certain it is there is a great Diſtance of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: and as the holy Souls in their Regions of Light are full of Love, Joy, Hope, and Longing for the Coming of the Great Day; ſo the Accurſed do expect it with an inſupportable Amazement, and are preſently tormented with Apprehenſions of the Future. Happy are they that through Paradice paſs into the Kingdom, who from their higheſt Hope, paſs to the greateſt Charity; from the State of a bleſſed Separation, to the Mercies and gentle Sentence of the Day of Judgment, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed to <hi>God</hi> to grant <hi>Oneſiphorus;</hi> and more explicitly for the <hi>Theſſalonians, that their whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body, be preſerved blameleſs unto the Coming of our Lord Jeſus.</hi> And I pray God to grant the ſame to me, and all Faithful People whatſoever. <hi>Life and Death of the Holy Jeſus,</hi> Sect. 16. §. 1.</p>

                     <p>WE find in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> did pray, and make Offerings for the Dead: which alſo appears by other Teſtimonies, and by their Forms of Prayer ſtill extant, which they uſed in their Captivity. It is very conſiderable, that ſince
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41224:52"/>
                        <hi>our bleſſed Saviour</hi> did reprove all the evil Doctrines and Traditions of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and did argue concerning the <hi>Dead</hi> and the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> againſt the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> yet he ſpake no word againſt this publick Practice, but left it as he found it: which He, who came to declare to us all the Will of his Father, would not have done, if it had not been Innocent, Pious, and full of Charity.</p>
                     <p>To which, by way of Conſociation, if we add, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> did pray for <hi>Oneſiphorus, That God would give him Mercy at that Day;</hi> that is, according to the Stile of the New Teſtament, the Day of Judgment; the reſult will be, That altho' it be probable that <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiphorus</hi> was at that time dead; becauſe in his Salutations he ſalutes his Houſhold, without naming him who was <hi>Major domo,</hi> againſt his Cuſtom of Salutations in other places: yet beſides this, the Prayer was for ſuch a Bleſſing to him, whoſe Demonſtration and Reception could not be but after Death: which implies clearly that there is a Need of Mercy; and, by conſequence, the <hi>Dead People,</hi> even to the Day of Judgment, incluſively are the Subject of a Miſery, the Object of God's Mercy, and therefore fit to be commemorated in the Duties of our Piety and Charity; and that we are to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Condition to God, not only to give them more Glory in the Re-union, but to pity them to ſuch purpoſes in which they need: Which, becauſe they are not revealed to us in particular, it hinders us not in recommending the Perſons in particular to God's Mercy, but ſhould rather excite our Charity and Devotion: For it being certain that they have a Need of Mercy, and it being uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain how great their Need is, it may concern the Prudence of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be more earneſt, as not knowing the Greatneſs of their Neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>And if there ſhould be any Uncertainty in theſe Arguments, yet its having been <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Practice of the Church of God</hi> in all Places, and in all Ages, till within theſe Hundred Years, it is a very <hi>great Inducement</hi> for any Member of the Church to believe that in the firſt Traditions of Chriſtianity, and the Inſtitutions Apoſtolical, there was nothing delivered a ainſt this Practice, but very much to inſinuate or enjoin it; becauſe the Practice of it was at the firſt, and was Univerſal. And if any Man ſhall doubt of this, he ſhews no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that he is ignorant of the Records of the Church, it being plain in <hi>Tertullian</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> (who were the eldeſt Writers of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church) that in their time it was, <hi>ab Antiquo,</hi> the Cuſtom of the Church to pray for the Souls of the Faithful departed in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41224:53"/>dreadful Myſteries. And it was an Inſtitution Apoſtolical, (ſays one of them) and ſo tranſmitted to the following Ages of the Church: And when once it began to be conteſted againſt by <hi>Aerius,</hi> the Man was preſently condemn'd for a Heretick, as appears in <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius.
